<plain_text><page sequence="1">39 the existence of an endostyle-a system of ramified intestinal tu- bules-and of oither organs precisely resembling those described in the latter genus. The "hepatic organ" of Savigny is the testis, while the female generative organ consists of solitary pedicillate ova. The arrangement of their parts is essentially the same as in Salpa, only that the foetus does not appear to be developed in pla- cental connexion with the parent. The Pyrosomata increase by gemmation also, but the gemmm are solitary and do not form chains, becoming developed like those of the ordinary compound Ascidians between the pre-existing forms. In the next section, the zoological relations of the Salpee and Pyrosomata, with the other Ascidians, are inquired into. The au- thor endeavours to show that there is no essential difference of or- ganization between the ordinary Ascidians and the Salpce; that the two forms grade insensibly one into the other; and that there is, therefore, no ground for breaking up the great ascidian family into the two subdivisions of Monochitonida and Dichitonida. With regard to the theory of the "alternation of generations," the author submits that it is by no means a proper expression for the phaenomena presented by the Salpce. According to the author's view, the two forms of Salpa are not two generations of distinct in- dividuals, but are, properly speaking, organs, and only when taken together, equivalent to an individual, in the sense in which that term is used among the higher animals. For these pseudo-individuals, in this and all analogous cases, the author proposes the name of " zooids," simply for the purpose of avoiding the apparent paradox of calling these highly-organized in- dependent forms "organs," though such, in the author's opinion, they really are. The following letter, addressed to S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., by James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S., " On the Extraordinary Fall of Rain in the neighbourhood of London on the 15th instant," was read. "13 Dartmouth Terrace, Blackheath. 1851, March 27. "MY DEAR SIR,-The fall of rain in the neighbourhood of London on the 15th instant was so remarkable, that I think an ac- count of it will be interesting to the Fellows of the Royal Society. "' At Greenwich it commenced falling about 1 o'clock A.M., and by 9" A.M. the amount fallen was 1 inch, and by 4 o'clock P.M. at the Royal Observatory 1*45 inch was measured; at Lewisham the fall was 1 725 inch; in London an inch nearly had fallen by 9h A.M., and by 4h P.M. the amount collected was 1"25 inch. " These quantities are unusual at any season, but particularly so in the month of March; there is no record either in the MSS. of the Royal Observatory, or in the Philosophical Transactions, of so large a fall in any day in the month of March, and, so far as I can find, it is unplecedentedly large. " The annexed table shows the amount of rain fallen on this day at various places in England and Ireland.</page><page sequence="2">40 Fall of rain Wind. Names of Places. in inches. . - Direction.

At many places the day was fine and bright. "The change of wind from S. nearly to S.E. by midnight on the 14th, and to N.E. at about the time the fall began, and the change of wind just before the rain ceased to N.N.W., indicate that this great fall of rain in so short a time was attributable to the meeting of two currents of air of different temperatures, and the consequent great deposition of moisture. "c It will be seen that the weather in Ireland on this day was for the most part fine. " I am, dear Sir, "Yours very faithfully, "JAMES GLAISHIER." "P.S.

A paper was read, entitled " Observations upon Appendicularia and Doliolum." By Thomas H. Huxley, Esq. Communicated by E. Forbes, Esq., F.R.S. Received Feb. 26, 1851. This is a description of two Ascidian genera which possess very considerable interest: Doliolum, as forming a link between the Pyrosomata and Salpoe; and Appendicularia, as representing in a permanent form the larval state of the Ascidians, long ago described by M. Milne-Edwards. Appendicularia, which has been also imperfectly described under the names of Oikopleura and Venillaria, is in fact an ascidian pro- vided with a long vibratile fin or tail, by the aid of which it swims freely about. That it is an adult form is shown by the existence of a well- developed testis, but the author leaves undecided the nature of the female organs. On the other hand it seems doubtful whether Doliolum is truly an independent form, or whether it is not rather a detached " zo6id" of the genus Auchenia.
