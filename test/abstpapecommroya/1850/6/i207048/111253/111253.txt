The author states that the experiment of a new method of propa- gating plants has been so successful, that he has taken the liberty of forwarding to the Royal Society this short paper upon the sub- ject, for the guidance of those who are interested in the advance of horticulture. It had occurred to him, that if a cutting of a plant were sealed at the base, so as to exclude the moisture of the soil from ascending the stem in injurious quantities, the method of striking cuttings of most species of plants would not be so precarious a process:as at present; and accordingly some collodion was obtained in order to make the experiment. With respect to this new process, he states, that immediately upon the cutting being severed from the parent stem, the collodion was applied to the wound, and then left a few seconds to dry, after which the cuttings were potted in the ordinary manner. To test the value of this new process more effectually, duplicates of all the species experimented upon were at the same time similarly planted, without the collodion being applied to them. Experiments were carried on in two different ways; one batch of cuttings being placed on a hot-bed, whilst a second batch was planted in the open ground, without even the protection of glass.

Not- withstanding the season being too far advanced for the full benefit of the process to be thoroughly observed, still twice as many cut- tings took root treated by the new method as had rooted by the old. The mortalityin the open ground was increased by slugs having eaten off above the soil some of the cuttings; those thus damaged were examined after they had been in the ground a month, and it was found that the collodion was quite as sound as when first ap- plied. It would therefore appear that the collodion seals the wound of the cutting, and protects it from the fatal effects of.damp, until roots are prepared to force through the covering of gun-cotton. :It is further stated, that the application of this solution has been found to be exceedingly beneficial in the pruning of such plants as Euphor- bia speciosa, Impatiens latifolia, Impatiens latifolia-alba, Hoya bella, Hoya imperialis, &amp;c., the cut branches being prevented from bleed- ing. It is the author's intention next spring to follow out this experi- ment, in budding and grafting, as he considers that it will also be useful in this branch of horticulture. Gutta-percha, dissolved in oether, was in some instances substi- tuted to heal the wounds caused by pruning; yet owing to this so- lution not drying, as rapidly as collodion, the first, and sometimes the second application was not sufficient. The effect of these solutions upon cut flowers was very marked. Two branches were gathered as nearly alike as possible; to the flower-stalks of the one, collodion was applied. These flowers were placed in vases filled with water; those coated over with collodion began to fade in thirty-six hours, and many -were quite</page><page sequence="3">378 dead in three days whilst the flowers merely placed in water in the ordinary manner remained fresh and healthy . Those that faded soonest were Reseda odorata and Tropceolum majus, and those which were least affected were Tagetes erecta and Senecio erubescens. 4. "On the Acidity, Sweetness, and Strength of Wine, Beer and Spirits." By H. Bence Jones, M.D., F.R.S. Received Nov. 17, 1853. (1.) The acidity of the different liquids was determined by means of a standard solution of caustic soda. The quantity of liquid neu- tralized was always equal in bulk to 1000 grs. of water at 60? F. The acidity in different- Sherries varied from 1'95 grs. to 2*85 grs. of caustic soda. Madeira ,, 2-70 ,, 3-60 Port ,, 210 ,, 2-55 Claret ,, 255 ,, 3-45 Burgundy ,, 255 , 405 ,, Champagne ,, 240 ,, 315 , Rhine wine , 315 ,, 3'60 ,, Moselle ,, 2-85 ,, 450 Brandy , 015 ,, 0-60 Rum ,, 015 ,, 0'30 Geneva , 0-07 Whisky ,, 0'07 Bitter ale ,, 090 ,, 165 Porter ,, 180 ,, 210 , Stout ,, 135 ,, 225 Cider ,, 1'85 ,, 3-90 Hence the order in which these wines may be arranged, beginning with the least acid, is Sherry, Port, Champagne, Claret, Madeira, Burgundy, Rhine, Moselle. (2.) The sugar was determined by means of Soleil's saccha. rometer, which at least gives the lowest limit to the amount of sugar. The sweetness in different-- Sherries varied from 4 grs. to 18 grs. in the ounce. Madeira ,, 6 ,, 20 , Champagne ,, 6 , 28 , Port ,, 16 ,, 34 M^lmsy ,, 56 ,, 66 , Tokay , 74 Samos , 88 Paxarette ,, 94 , Claret, Burgundy, Rhine, and Moselle contained no sugar.
