The author found that this biniodide sub- limes at a temperature of 356? F., while the proto-iodide, if protected from the contact of air, may be heated to redness without subliming. The author did not succeed in obtaining a combination of tin and iodine corresponding to the sesquioxide, although Boullay supposes that such was the composition of some yellow crystals which were formed by the mixture of solutions of proto-chloride of tin and of iodide of potassium. A more detailed account of the properties of the iodides of tin is reserved for a future communication. Supplement to a Paper " On the Nervous Ganglia of the Uterus." By Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of the Royal College of Phy- sicians. The author is confirmed in his views regarding the arrangement of the nervous filaments distributed to the uterus, as described in his papers printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 18 41 and 1842, by his recent dissection of a gravid uterus at the full period, and which he considers as demonstrative of the accuracy of all the state- ments which are contained in those communications.</page></plain_text>
