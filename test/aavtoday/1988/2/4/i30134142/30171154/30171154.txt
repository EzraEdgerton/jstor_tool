<plain_text><page sequence="1">Veterinary Computer Society An organization of interest to the practitioner/computer user is the American Veterinary Computer Socie- ty (AVCS). The Society has four classes of membership: Active (veterinary practitioners, veterinarians and professional staff of Colleges of Veterinary Medicine and Diagnostic Laboratories); Associate (persons who support the goals of AVCS); Suppor- ting (producers of computers and related products); and Student (veterinary students). Annual dues are $10 for all membership categonries. The primary purpose of the organization is to disseminate com- puter information. AVCS publishes articles of interest to its members in every other issue of DVM. The group recently produced a membership directory which lists each person's area of computer expertise and in- terest. A current major project is the computerization of the Merck Veterinary Manual by Stephen Waldhalm of Mississippi State University, which is scheduled for completion this year and will be presented at the 1990 Western Veterinary Conference in Las Vegas. AVCS is also currently planning their Sixth International Meeting to be held in Guelph, Canada in August. Further information about AVCS may be obtained from Dr. Stephen Waldhalm, Secretary-Treasurer, Drawer V, College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State, MS 39762.</page></plain_text>
