Flushot + can reveal 22 of the 39 known viruses, which is greater pro- tection than most other virus- fighting agents that retail for much more. It an be obtained as shareware for only $10.00 from its author, Ross Greenberg, (212) 889-6431. C-4, whose name comes from Cybernetic Xylene, an inhibitor of carbon-based animal viruses, is pro- bably the best commercial inhibitor available today. It stops the spread of all the 39 currently known viral pro- grams. It can be purchased from In- terpath, 4423 Cheeney St., Santa Clara, CA 95054 for $20.00. -Richard B.
