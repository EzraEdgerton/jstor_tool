<plain_text><page sequence="1">Intestinal Tract Therapy Metoclopramide HCI (Reglan, A.H. Robins) is a modifier of gastric and upper small intestinal motility that has been widely utilized in human and small animal medicine. In birds, we have employed the drug in cases of delayed or abnormal pro- ventricular emptying, and in several cases of regurgitation/vomiting associated with bacterial inflammation of the upper G.I. tract. While a con- trolled evaluation was not performed, significant clinical improvement at- tributed to the use of the agent was noted.
