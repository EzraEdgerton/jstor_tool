<plain_text><page sequence="1">Use of Physical Therapy (From The Wildhlfe Center of Virginia Progress Report, Fall, 1987) A major problem associated with the treatment of avian fracture repair is a stiffening of the immobilized joints and muscles.

After healing has taken place birds fre- quently have difficulty extending their wings. Our routine post-immobilization treatment is to place the patient in a flight pen and allow it to gradually increase its exercise and activity. Those birds with fractures away from their joints do well with this techni- que. However, the closer the fracture is to the joint, the more difficult it is for the bird to regain full use of its wings. I contacted a licensed physical therapist who volunteered to train our staff in some of the physical therapy techniques used in human medicine. He demonstrated friction massage, range of motion, and ultra- sound therapy to help loosen up the joints on some of our patients. Our staff has already seen dramatic results from the use of these new techniques. One gunshot Red-tailed Hawk, which had undergone surgical repair of both its humerus and tibiotarsus, is now flying 300 feet as a result of physical therapy. Prior to this therapy, the bird could extend its wing only 150 and would not use its leg. - Stuart Porter, VMD, Weyers Cave, Virginia</page></plain_text>
