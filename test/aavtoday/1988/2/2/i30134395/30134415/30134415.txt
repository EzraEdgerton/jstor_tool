<plain_text><page sequence="1">Quality Anesthesia in the Field Historically, anesthesia of avian pa- tients in field situations has often utilized techniques of parenteral or inhalant administration that, while arguably effective, lack the control and/or safety levels compatible with good anesthetic practice. For the past year we have employed a portable, modular anesthetic system, developed in cooperation with Med-Vet Systems, that consists of an isoflurane vaporizer, flowmeter, Bain circuit, and an E oxygen cylinder. The com- ponents are mounted on a cart that is easily disassembled for transport. Aluminum oxygen cylinders are used to further reduce weight. The unit can be taken into an aviary situation and used to deliver a high standard of inhalation anesthesia. Recently we were asked to laparoscope a group of Crowned Cranes. Like other Gruidae, these birds are excitable, and have easily damaged long legs. The cranes were anesthetized and laparoscoped near their holding area, requiring a minimum of handling and transport. After being masked down with an incrementally-increased concentration of isoflurane, they were intubated. The patients were monitored con- tinuously and IPPV was administered as necessary. When the procedure was completed, birds were assisted in recovery until they could stand un- aided, which seldom took longer than 10 minutes. Rapid recoveries, the hallmark of isoflurane anesthesia, are especially useful in avian patients with physical and psychological at- tributes that may lead to trauma in recovery. Delivery of quality anesthesia in the field can be useful in reducing handling and transport stessors under selected conditions. - Michael Taylor, DVM, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</page></plain_text>
