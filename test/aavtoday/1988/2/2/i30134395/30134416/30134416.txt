<plain_text><page sequence="1">Method for Reducing Contact with Inhalation Anesthetics Because I have a sensitivity to in- halation anesthetics, I needed to devise a method for performing surgical procedures in a way that minimized my contact with these agents. We constructed a plexiglass box that fits over the head of the bird, and attached a Nutonea bathroom fan (which is capable of pulling 300 cubic feet of air per minute). The gas is pulled through a flexible dryer hose and out a vent. Since all the work is done with the head of the bird and the gas underneath the plexiglass hood, the exposure of the surgeon to the gas is dramatically reduced. One should keep in mind that birds recovering from methoxyflurane anesthesia breathe off the gas for awhile. If several recovering birds are in the same room, you can smell the methoxyflurane very quickly. If possi- ble, I would suggest moving the birds to a room separate from the surgeon for recovery. - Scott McDonald, DVM, Westchester, Illinois</page></plain_text>
