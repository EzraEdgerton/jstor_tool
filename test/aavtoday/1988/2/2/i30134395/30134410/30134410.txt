<plain_text><page sequence="1">Use of "Snowshoe" Splinting and Bandaging Technique For low cost treatment of certain fractures of the toes, tarsometatarsus, or extreme distal tibiotarsus, we use a splinting technique we refer to as a "snowshoe." The toes are taped flat to a platform of cardboard; then up to ten layers of tape are applied to the cardboard and up over the leg. This is also a useful technique in the treatment of Amazon foot necrosis syndrome, where it is important to keep the bird from chewing affected areas. The bird is able to stand, but cannot pick through the tape. - Scott McDonald, DVM, Westchester, Illinois</page></plain_text>
