<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alternative IM Pins We use 20 gauge spinal needles from human hospitals as in- tramedullary pins in birds. They are sharp-pointed, non-reactive, lightweight, hollow, and inexpensive. Because they are flexible, they can be maneuvered around. We may use 2 or 3 in a single fracture repair. - James Gaines, DVM, Chantilly, Virginia</page></plain_text>
