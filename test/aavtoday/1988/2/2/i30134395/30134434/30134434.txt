<plain_text><page sequence="1">Restraining Boards for Radiographs Over the last thirty years I have used a variety of holders to radiograph birds: taping birds to X-ray film, homemade devices, sandbags, "three technicians and a trained monkey". I then tried the Silverdust Bird Posi- tioner, an acrylic bird-holding device designed by Sam Silverman and Lynn Dustin. I have found this to be un- questionably the most useful avian practice aid to come down the pike in the last twenty-five years. The board allows for excellent VD and lateral radiographic positioning without anesthesia for birds in the size range from conures to large macaws. The heavy-duty head restraint pieces come in four sizes with atraumatic beveled edges. All four pieces are large enough so the patient cannot access the technician's hands while in place, or while being applied or removed, and are thick enough to prevent large macaws from biting through them. The feet are tied to built-in cleats with gauze or rope and the wings are taped to the board. This device is also useful in minor surgeries or other procedures requir- ing recumbent immobilization. - James M. Harris, DVM, Oakland, California</page></plain_text>
