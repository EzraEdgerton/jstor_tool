<plain_text><page sequence="1">General Cautions with Isoflurane Isoflurane is a potent, insoluble, inhalant anesthetic. These qualities, combined with the relative efficiency of the avian respiratory system, may lead to respiratory and cardiac arrest, particularly in situations where high concentrations of the agent are ad- ministered during a face mask induc- tion. There can be marked variation in species and individual patient response to isoflurane. I have found that patient safety is increased by beginning administration at 0.5% and increasing the concentration by increments to effect. The use of this technique takes advantage of the ex- cellent physicochemical qualities of isoflurane, while allowing the practi- tioner to anesthetize a spectrum of species with maximum safety. High initial concentrations of isoflurane in an excited avian patient are to be avoided. Although there is somewhat of a safety margin between dose-related respiratory depression and cardiac depression, there may be times when the ability to use intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) can be very important. We have found par- ticular problems with African Greys. Even with incremental induction techniques, some birds will start to have very shallow ventilation. I feel that intubation with a soft, uncuffed tube, such as the Magill 96 AAV TODAY</page><page sequence="2">tube (available through human anesthetic supply firms), is very valuable. By intubating birds, establishing an airway and using a low-flow system like the Bain circuit, one can control ventilation and the anesthetic much more safely, especial- ly for periods of anesthesia longer than 15 minutes. - Michael Taylor, DVM, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</page></plain_text>
