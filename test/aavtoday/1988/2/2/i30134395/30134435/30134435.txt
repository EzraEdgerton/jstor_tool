<plain_text><page sequence="1">Input on Leucocytozoonosis Requested During the past year, we have con- tinued to lose birds to presumptive Leucocytozoon sp. infection. Gross le- sions are identical in all birds and are described in "Leucocytozoonosis in Crested Oropendolas (Psarcolius decumanus)", AAV Today 1(4):155-157. Losses have been sporadic and have included the oropendolas, 2 Fairy Bluebirds and 1 Keel-billed Toucan. I would ap- preciate hearing from anyone who has lost birds to this problem or has seen similar gross lesions on post mortem examination. - C. Douglas Page, DVM, Jackson- ville Zoo, 8605 Zoo Road, Jackson- ville, Florida (904) 757-4463 102 AAV TODAY</page></plain_text>
