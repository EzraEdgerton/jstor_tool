Schmidt, DVM, PhD* Lynn R. Dustin, DVM** Richard W. Slevin, DVM*** Summary Proventricular adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in a budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus,) and a Grey- cheeked Parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhopteruś,). A tentative diagnosis of gastric neoplasia was made in the budgerigar based on radiographic studies . The Grey-cheeked Parakeet died before clinical evaluations could be performed; histology was required to distinguish the proventricular lesion from chronic inflammatory process. Proventricular carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal disease. A jLjLvian neoplasia has been the subject of several reviews and case reports.1-6 Although neoplasia of the proventriculus was not reported in the reviews, one case report1 described a proventricular adenoma in a Brazilian Teal ( Amazonetta brasiliensis), and one additional reference included a radiograph of an Amazon parrot with proventricular adenocarcinoma.7 This paper describes the occurrence of proventricular adenocarcinoma in two unrelated psittacine species with differing clinical signs. CASE REPORTS A seven-year-old male English budgerigar ( Melopsittacus undulatus ) was initially presented after vomiting water and mucus the previous day. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from the feces. Clinical laboratory results revealed a slight monocytosis of 120 absolute, or 6% of an estimated WBC of 1000-3000 (normal = 0-5 %8), a low serum calcium of 6.0 mg/dl (normal = 8.0-12.0 mg/dl9) and an elevated creatinine kinase (CK) of 734 IU/ml (normal = 100- 200 IU/ml8). Therapy consisted of intramuscular administration of amikacin,3 (2.5 mg solution for 9 days), and the recom- mendation of a low fat diet. Four months following initial presentation the bird was returned because of regurgitation. At this time the crop appeared to be distended with gas. Survey radiographs (Fig. 1A) demonstrated an irregular, ovoid, 1 cm radiolucency in the dorsal caudal thorax /cranial abdominal regions which appeared to have a wall of approx- imately 2-3 mm thickness. Ventriculus was displaced slight- *California Veterinary Diagnostics, Inc., West Sacramento, California **Sunset Veterinary Hospital, San Francisco, California ** 'Madison Avenue Veterinary Clinic, Fair Oaks, California 140 AAV TODAY</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1.

Micro-pulverized barium sulfate suspension (85%) was diluted 50:50 with warm tap water, and 2 Vi ml of the mix- ture was administered by crop tube. Ventrodorsal and lateral radiographs were taken immediately following barium ad- ministration and 15 minutes later. Initially, a distension of the crop and caudal proventriculus was demonstrated with contrast medium. A small amount of contrast medium traversed the proventriculus and entered the ventriculus. There was a linear "string-like" column of barium in the area normally occupied by the distal proven- triculus. This was visualized on lateral and VD radiographs (Fig IB). Radiographic conclusions were that the proventricular gaseous distension on the survey radiographs was probably secondary to an intramural infiltrative lesion which was pro- ducing partial distal proventricular obstruction. Neoplasia was considered the most likely cause, due to the discreet nature of the lesion; infectious lesions would be much less likely since the mucosal pattern of the proventriculus was unremarkable proximal to the site of partial obstruction. Over the next month the bird continued to vomit once or twice daily. It became anorectic and died approximately 5 months following initial presentation. The only significant gross lesion seen during necropsy was a band of abnormal, firm, smooth, white tissue extending through the full thickness of the proventriculus. Histological- ly, the tissue was neoplastic, originating in the proventricular mucosa, with extension into the submucosa (Fig. 2A). Neoplastic cells had indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries and vesicular nuclei. The cells formed small nests that infiltrated into the submucosa and muscularis (Fig. 2B). Based on histology, the tumor was considered to be an adenocarcinoma. The second case was a female Grey-cheeked Parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhopterus) of unknown age. The owner reported that the bird had been lethargic for several days. Clinically, the bird was thin and was passing small amounts of fecal material. Despite the initiation of antibiotic therapy (amikacin, 0.15 mg /kg IM and doxycycline calcium oral suspension,0 20 mg/kg per os) and tube feeding, the bird died that evening. At necropsy the bird was thin, and minimal ascitic fluid and peritoneal fibrin were present. At the proventricular- ven- tricular junction, the proventricular wall was thin and the serosa was hemorrhagic. Gastric contents extruded into the a.

Histologically, the affected area was similar to that seen in the budgerigar described above. The adenocarcinoma was infiltrated through the entire wall, and foci of necrosis and hemorrhage were pre- sent. The serosal surface and associated mesentery were inflamed. DISCUSSION Although there are increasing numbers of reports of neoplasia in psittacine birds, malignant proventricular tumors are rarely described. This may be due to infrequency of com- plete necropsy and histologic examination of these tissues. The two cases reported present a contrast for the clinician. A tentative clinical diagnosis was made in the first bird due to the length of the illness and the desires of the owner for a thorough clinical and laboratory examination. The second bird was presented essentially moribund with no opportuni- ty for clinical and laboratory investigation. The low blood calcium noted on clinical laboratory ex- amination was believed not to be related to a nutritional defi- ciency, as the animal was on a well-balanced diet. In mam- mals, gastric carcinomas usually cause elevated blood calcium due to excessive bile acid production. One can speculate this bird may have suffered from calcium malabsorption due to the proventricular adenocarcinoma. This neoplasm may have caused a decrease in gastric secretion needed for calcium uptake. The reason for the high CK was not specifically determin- ed. CK is a somewhat nonspecific enzyme in birds and the elevation may have been due to damage to normal tissue in the proventriculus or some unrelated pathology. Based on observations of the authors, carcinoma of the pro- ventriculus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic upper gastrointestinal disease, and also when possi- ble ulceration and perforation of the proventriculus are observed grossly. Histologic examination of the neoplasm was necessary in the Grey-cheeked Parakeet in order to distinguish the lesion from a chronic inflammatory process. REFERENCES 1 .
