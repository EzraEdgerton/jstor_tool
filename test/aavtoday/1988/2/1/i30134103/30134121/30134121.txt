<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clinical Use of Electronic ID System Because of the increased incidence of bird theft, fly-aways, and dif- ficulties in keeping track of aviary birds, and the impermanence of leg bands and tatoos, we are using the American Veterinary Identification Devices, Inc. electronic ID system in our practice for birds the size of cockatiels or larger, rabbits, guinea pigs, reptiles, and koi carp. The microchip, encased in a sterilized glass pellet, is injected under the skin, where it resides permanently. A computerized record of the identifica- tion number is maintained at our clinic. The fee is $25 when the pro- cedure is performed during an exam visit or surgical sexing. This includes application of the microchip, a print- out of the identification, and unlimited scanning for five years. We also offer quantity discounts. - Alan M.
