<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hypervitaminosis A in Parrots Contrary to what I have heard, overdose of vitamin A can occur in parrots. One parrot, given weekly ADE injections and fed tremendous amount of carrots daily developed dry, cracked skin, appeared burnt orange in color, and had an SGOT increase. (I saw similar symptoms in a dog fed an entire bunch of carrots daily. Its SGPT, AP and other en- zyme levels also increased.) Both became normal after a reduction in dietary vitamin A. - Walter J.
