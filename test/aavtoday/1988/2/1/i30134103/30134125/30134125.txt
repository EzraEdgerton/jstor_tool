<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comments on New Arthroscope I was told by a local Dyonics representative that their new 1.7 mm VideoArthroscope is specifically designed for working in a wet field. When this instrument is used in human procedures, fluid is constantly being flushed through the surgical site. Surgical sexing and other diagnostic procedures in birds are conducted in a "dry" field, thus this particular instrument is less ap- propriate for avian use than other arthroscopes manufactured by this company. - Scott McDonald, DVM, Westchester, Illinois</page></plain_text>
