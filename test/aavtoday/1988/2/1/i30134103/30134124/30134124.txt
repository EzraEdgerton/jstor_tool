<plain_text><page sequence="1">Incidence of Papillomatosis I don't recall seeing papillomatosis in pet birds until around 1982, but I really wasn't looking for it. Now it seems to be a very prevalent condi- tion, especially in South and Central American species. From what I have observed, Green- winged Macaws appear to have the highest incidence of cloacal papillomatosis, followed by Blue and Gold Macaws and to a lesser degree, by Scarlet and Military Macaws. The condition is very common in mini- macaws and Hawkheads. Of the Amazons, Blue-fronts and Double Yellow-heads are the worst, but it is also occasionally seen in other Amazons. I just recently saw the identical clinical signs for the first time in a conure - this one was a Peach-fronted. Although it has been reported by another veterinarian in African Greys, I have never seen it in that species, nor in any Australian birds. Birds with cloacal papillomatosis almost always produce significant growth of E. coli on culture. It is in- teresting to speculate if and how the E. coli might be related to the hyperplasia.
