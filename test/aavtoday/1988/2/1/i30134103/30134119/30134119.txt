<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plunger as Perch My happiest moment in avian prac- tice was when I accidentally discovered that the standard $1.99 red rubber toilet bowl plunger with wooden handle (that can be pur- chased in most grocery or hardware stores) fits perfectly across the Shoreline cages. This makes an inex- pensive, disposable perch that can be positioned anywhere within the cage. - Teresa L. Lightfoot, DVM, Largo, Florida</page></plain_text>
