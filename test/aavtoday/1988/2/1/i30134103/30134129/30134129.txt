<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sterilization of Nest Boxes with Methyl Bromide Methyl bromide is a gas commonly used as a fumigant to control insects and as a soil sterilizer. It has also been shown to be quite effective against fungi. Breeders who operate large aviaries may find it cost pro- hibitive to replace used nest boxes every year as a sanitary measure. Fumigation with methyl bromide by a certified pest control operator may be an easy and inexpensive alternative. I cultured used but clean nest boxes at the end of the breeding season at a private aviary in Florida and grew gram (+) bacteria, pathogenic gram (-) bacteria and Aspergillus. The same nest boxes, some with and some without shavings in the bottom, were then fumigated under plastic for two days. Subse- quent culture failed to grow any organisms. Methyl bromide dissipates rapidly, and boxes can be put back in use one day after airing out. - Michael Bodri, Class of 1988, Southampton, Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
