<plain_text><page sequence="1">Human Tatoo Ink Recommended For tatooing birds in the wing web following surgical sexing, I would recommend using black tatoo ink manufactured for human use. I am aware of some sterility problems with veterinary quality ink, and colors other than black appear to fade more quickly. Tatoo ink of any type can be plac- ed in a sterile vial and sterilized. Some practitioners who have noted bacterial septicemias or irritation of the wing web following tatooing have found this to be effective. I have not found sterility to be a problem in ink I buy from S &amp; W Tatoo Co., East Northport, New York. - Scott McDonald, DVM, Westchester, Illinois</page></plain_text>
