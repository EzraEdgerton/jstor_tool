<plain_text><page sequence="1">Care of Flamingo Feet The primary factor in preventing cracked feet in flamingos appears to be texture of the substrate of pond bottoms and shores. The use of soft clay and grass is recommended. Ad [ justments in the diet to prevent this j from occurring, such as biotin or Vitamin A supplementation, have made no difference. Concrete appears to be the worst substrate. It would probably also be advantageous for flamingo exhibits to contain brackish water. ?
