<plain_text><page sequence="1">Splints for Tibiotarsal Fractures In raptors (and in parrots), tibiotar sal fractures can be splinted in 99% of the cases. I.M. pinning, advocated by many, is just not necessary. I have done hundreds of raptors and a similar number of psittacines this way and have had no problems. Needless surgery can therefore be avoided. I use gauze, then 2 tongue blades, then Elastikon? in raptors. In small birds, simple tape splints suffice. In large parrots, it works fine to use Vetwrap? covered by gauze, then thick Elastikon. I have not had to pluck feathers with this technique. Leg function, hunting, etc. is perfect afterwards, even if slight overlap of the bone ends occurs. The key is that the leg is straight. Bone remodeling will achieve perfection. ? Walter J.
