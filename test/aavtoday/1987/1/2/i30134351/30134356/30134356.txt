<plain_text><page sequence="1">PBFDS in Greater Vasa Parrots Feather loss in three Greater Vasa Parrots was grossly and micro- scopically typical of psittacine beak and feather disease syndrome (PBFDS). Feathers appeared clubbed with retained shafts and annular constrictions. Beak lesions or cytoplasmic inclusions were not observed. The parrots were recently imported by two separate quarantine stations. There was no direct exposure to cockatoos. One station owner reported the syndrome as "common" in Vasa Parrots. Two birds have now been maintained in aviaries for nine months with no improvement in feathering. It is important to recognize this syndrome in Vasa Parrots and to distinguish it from feather plucking or feather color alterations, both common in these birds. - Nicole VanDerHeyden, D VM, Purdue University, Lafayette, Indiana</page></plain_text>
