<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mycobacteriosis in Gouldian Finches We have identified a form of M. avium in Gouldian finches that does not cause typical avian tuberculosis. Flocks affected with this form have experienced high morbidity with low mortalities usually precipitated by stressful events such as crowding, competition, or shipment. Birds of all ages from 3 separately owned flocks have been involved. Postmortems show virtually no gross lesions, and birds are often in good nutritional condition; but histologically most have numerous acid-fast bacilli scattered throughout the liver and other organs. The bacilli are usually found in a few clusters of macrophages, but many are extracellular. Cultures of a number of these birds from one flock have revealed a non-serotypeable strain of M. avium with colony characteristics that differ from conventional strains of M. avium. The organism seems to be sensitive to saturated borate transport solution and is best recovered from frozen material. This mycobacterium seems to have adapted to the Gouldians without producing progressive disease; flocks harboring the bacillus, however, have higher incidences of stress- related or otherwise unexplained deaths. We currently refer to the condition as mycobacteriosis (Type II) to distinguish it from typical avian tuberculosis. So far, antemortem diagnosis is difficult and no successful treatment is known. - R.J. Montali and D. Nichols, National Zoological Park; J.L.
