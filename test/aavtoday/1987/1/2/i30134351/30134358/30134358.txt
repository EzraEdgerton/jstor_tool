<plain_text><page sequence="1">Update On Paramyxovirus Type I Infection In Domestic Pigeons I diagnose two to three flock outbreaks of avian paramyxovirus type I infection in racing pigeons following each racing season (spring and fall). The clinical manifestations have changed somewhat since the disease first appeared in the U.S. in 1984. My observations are: 1) The most prominent sign is leg paresis or paralysis, followed by wing paresis or paralysis. Torticollis and head tremors are now rare. 2) Transaminase enzyme determinations are usually normal. Low hematocrit and hemoglobin are the primary hematologic abnormalities. 3) Pigeons which survive a flock outbreak possess a protective immunity to the virus for at least one year. - Basil P.
