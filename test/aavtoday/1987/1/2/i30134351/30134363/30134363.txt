<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clinical Use of Acyclovir We have been using acyclovir for a number of clinical conditions including birds that have been exposed to highly suspicious or confirmed Pacheco's Disease cases. Exposed birds frequently have a blood picture of WBC 2000, with predominately lymphocytes and monocytes, and high SGOT. The general opinion seems to be that acyclovir is useful in "breaking" epidemics when it is administered early to exposed birds. If the bird is already showing clinical signs, acyclovir probably will not affect the outcome. I understand acyclovir has also been used in bird of prey herpesvirus outbreaks and has been successful in saving recently exposed birds. We administer acyclovir at 20 mg/kg b.i.d. by injection for a week. In pet shop situations we would use 1/4 the standard 200 mg acyclovir oral capsule per 4 oz. drinking water for 3 weeks. For cases of Amazon tracheitis virus, we would use supportive care, vitamins, antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial involvement and acyclovir. The cutaneous form of herpes- virus on the legs of cockatoos and macaws often responds to topical application of acyclovir cream for three weeks and concurrent administration of acyclovir capsules in the water. The skin herpesvirus seems to present differently in the two species: in cockatoos it tends to have a "cauliflower" appearance; macaws have a generalized plaque of whitish material. Birds recovered from this herpesvirus often have scars remaining on the legs. Acyclovir shows promise in avian medicine and needs further study. - Walter J.
