<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paramyxovirus Group 3 Infection in Cockatiels A large indoor cockatiel breeder began experiencing high morbidity and mortality in nestling cockatiels. Clinical signs included opisthotonus, tremors, leg paralysis and dyspnea. Hematology, bacteriology, para- sitology and electrocardiography were normal. CPK, LDH and SGOT values were markedly elevated. Gross post mortem findings included cardiomegaly and peri- cardial effusions. Microscopically VOL. 1 NO. 2 1987 53</page><page sequence="2">In My Experience...I the myocardium was diffusely infiltrated with lymphocytes, plasma cells and occasional heterophils. Intranuclear inclusions were observed within myofibrils and mononuclear cells. Neurological lesions were not observed despite extensive searching. Paramyxovirus Group 3 was isolated from the brains and hearts. Breeding was discontinued for six months and the premises thoroughly disinfected. The problem has not recurred at this time. - Nicole VanDerHeyden, D VM and Willie M. Reed, D VM, PhD, Purdue University, Lafayette, Indiana.</page></plain_text>
