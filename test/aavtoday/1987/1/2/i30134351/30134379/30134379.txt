<plain_text><page sequence="1">Post Mortem Blood Evaluation The collection of a post mortem blood sample can provide extremely useful information and should be the order rather than the exception for avian necropies. Even if the carcass has been (heaven forbid) frozen and thawed, I will still collect heart blood. The heart is the site where you will least likely encounter bacterial contamination of blood from other areas of the body. The collection needle should be inserted through the right ventricle into the right atrium to obtain the sample. If the surface has been contaminated before the sample is collected, a spatula should be heated to red hot over a Bunsen burner flame, the surface of the heart lightly seared, and the collection needle inserted through the seared surface. The post mortem blood sample can be treated as one would treat an antemortem sample. Blood smears can be made and stained with Wright's and Giemsa stains. Evidence of a bacteremia may be revealed by a Gram's stain. Evidence of hemoprotozoa may be seen, even if the heart blood has clotted and the clot has lysed. - David L.
