<plain_text><page sequence="1">Calcium- Needs And Dangers In a recent report, Blomquist' recommended levels of 1% calcium in the diets of mature nonbreeding pet and cage birds and 2.5% calcium for growing or repro- ductively active birds. Although no data were cited in support of these figures, it is likely that they are based on recommendations for egg- laying and rapidly growing chickens2. There is now a body of evidence which indicates that these levels of calcium are well in excess of the requirement and that 2.5% calcium causes deleterious effects in growing birds. Norris et aP found that adult White Leghorn male chickens were able to maintain bone calcium stores at 0.0025% calcium in the diet, but needed between 0.025% and 0.05% calcium to maintain normal plasma calcium levels and alkaline phosphatase activity. Rowland, et a14 found that non-laying White Leghorn hens were able to maintain bone strength at less than 0.02% calcium in the diet. Both of these levels are well below the 1% recommendation of Blomquist'. For growing birds the National Research Council2 recommends 1.2% calcium for turkeys from 0-8 weeks of age. This is the highest level of calcium recommended for any growing birds. Several investigators who have fed levels of calcium above the NRC recommendations have observed deleterious effects. Smith and Taylor' fed chickens from 1 day to 10 weeks of age and found reduced body weights and feed efficiency at 1.35% calcium as compared with 0.83% calcium. Shane, et a16 fed diets containing 0.6% or 3.0% calcium to chickens between 8 and 12 weeks of age. The higher levels produced visceral urate deposits, mortality, nephrosis and smaller parathyroid glands. Scott et a17 cite experiments at Cornell University in which chickens 8-18 weeks old fed diets containing more than 2.5% calcium had 10% to 20% mortality with an incidence of nephrosis, visceral gout, and calcium urate deposits in the ureters. Within one to two weeks on the high calcium diets pullets developed hypercalcemia and hypophos- phatemia. On the basis of these severe effects, they recommended feeding not more than 1.2% calcium in the diet of growing chickens. From the evidence obtained by the several workers cited above, levels of calcium in excess of 1.2% of the diet were found to cause a variety of problems in growing birds. A recommendation of 2.5%7o calcium for growing birds is clearly in excess of the calcium requirement and is likely to cause severe damage and even mortality in growing birds. Recent studies in our laboratory indicate that sustained egg production in cockatiels can be achieved by feeding diets containing less than 0.5% calcium. A maximum level for reproduction has not been determined, but it is 60 AAV TODAY</page><page sequence="2">known that 1.0% calcium is satisfactory for both breeding and growing birds. - T.E.
