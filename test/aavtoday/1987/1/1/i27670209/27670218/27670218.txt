<plain_text><page sequence="1">IME: Adverse Reaction to Pox Vaccine in Pigeons The owner of 60 young racing pigeons vaccinated all birds as recommended for the prevention of pox. Leg feathers were plucked and the vaccine was brushed into the empty follicles as directed. Ten of the birds came down with severe clinical signs - lethargy, off feed, and large lesions around the eyes and mouth. There were no deaths. One month later 24 birds were revaccinated with the same vaccine and no morbidity was noted. The vaccine was Vineland Pigeon Pox Vaccine of live virus chicken embryo origin. The vaccine is recommended for use as a prevention of pox in racing homer pigeons only. It may cause permanent lesions or feather color change which would disqualify exhibition or show pigeons. Vaccination should be administered only to healthy birds and can be done as early as 4 weeks of age. A vaccination "take" is determined by noting a swelling at the site of administration 10 to 14 days I following the vaccination. If no "take" is</page><page sequence="2"> evident the birds should be revaccinated. I I was not given information regarding "takes" following the first vaccinations. One reason for the lack of morbidity following the second vaccinations could be that those revaccinated birds had developed immunity. The owner has not experienced any further problems with pox virus. ? Richard R. Nye, DVM, Westchester, Illinois VOL.1 N0.1 1987 13</page></plain_text>
