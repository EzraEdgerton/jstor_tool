<plain_text><page sequence="1">IME: Cryogenic Storage of Budgerigar Semen Successful cryogenic preservation of the semen of a psittacine species (Melopsittacus undulatus) was achieved in this graduate degree study. Two diluents (BPSE and acetate), two dilution rations (1:2 and 1:3), different holding and equilibration times varying between 15 and 60 minutes, and several levels of DMSO were used to freeze semen. Five of 64 combinations, all with 10% DMSO, were found to yield mean motilities greater than 70% upon thawing; four of these were with acetate and a dilution ratio of 1:2. Holding and equilibration times of 30, 45, and 60 minutes were found to be optimum, but significant interaction was found between diluent, dilution ratio, and holding and equilibration time. Successful artificial insemination (AI) using the frozen-thawed semen was also achieved: 1 of 2 eggs produced was fertile. ?
