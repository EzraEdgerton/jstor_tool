<plain_text><page sequence="1">IME: Accessing World Literature via Computer Except for AAV TODAY, current "hot off the press" topics in non domestic avian medicine and surgery are spread out in numerous publications throughout the world. Now, with the advent of personal computers, this information is available right in your home or office. Several database suppliers are offering literature retrieval services pertaining to veterinary medicine. The undisputed best database (for veterinary medicine) is Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB), which is available only through Dialog Information Services, Inc., 3460 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 (800-3-DIALOG). I have found CAB to be an excellent source of avian literature, particularly articles from non North American sources. Hardware requirements include a personal computer with a modem and telecommunications software. Sufficient disk storage is important (preferably hard disk) so that search information can be downloaded at high speed into your computer and printed out later. Full citations and up to one-page English abstracts can be recovered. Cost is $55.00/hour, plus $0.35/record downloaded, plus telecommunications charges ($6-10/hour in U.S.). Access is available at any major metropolitan area worldwide. A typical search of under 10 minutes on a single topic usually costs under $20.00. Some university libraries and private services will do the search for you for an additional fee. ? Alan M. Fudge, DVM, Citrus Heights, California</page></plain_text>
