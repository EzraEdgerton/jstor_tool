<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ozone Generator Toxicity? Samples were submitted to our laboratory from a pet store with a steady die-off of birds. The store had been using an ozone generator which correlated with the onset of mortality. Pathologic findings included necrotiz- ing hepatitis and bacterial septicemia. Apparently output from these devices can be irritating to breathe, is moist, and can actually aerosolize bacteria which have grown in the device. - Alan M.
