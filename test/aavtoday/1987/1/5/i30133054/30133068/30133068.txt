<plain_text><page sequence="1">Update on Thyroid Function Testing Our experience with thyroid func- tion testing suggests that hypothyroidism is much less common in birds than it is in dogs. Although "hypothyroid" is commonly reported to practitioners by reference laboratories, we have encountered few birds with sparse feathering or abnor- mal molts that could probably be associated with hypothyroidism. Part of the problem is that with most of the commonly used assays, the nor- mal basals in many species of birds are at the low end of what can be measured, therefore the values appear to be in the hypothyroid range when in reality they are not. The ap- propriate way to diagnose hypothyroidism and to avoid this assay problem is to administer thyrotropin (TSH) and look for a significant increase in serum thyrox- ine concentration (T4). For birds that are truly hypothyroid, adminstration of the ap- propriate dose of thyroxine, either</page><page sequence="2">orally or in the drinking water, will correct the condition. This therapy, however, is not useful for symp- tomatic treatment of feather disorders in birds with normal thyroid function. -Clinton D.
