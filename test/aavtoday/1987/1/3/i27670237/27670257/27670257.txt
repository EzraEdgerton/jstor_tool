<plain_text><page sequence="1">Parrot Papovavirus Infection: Preventive Measures It is in the parrot nurseries of the aviculturist and retailer that generalized papovavirus infection has proven to be a significant disease in parrot species other than the budgerigar. Most affected young parrots are between two weeks to four months of age. They may die unexpectedly or evidence partial to complete anorexia and lethargy for one or two days prior to death. Extreme care should be exercised in the management of the parrot nursery to ensure that each nestling, or at least each set of commonly caged brood-mates, is physically and managerially isolated from the other birds and broods in the nursery. Each nestling or brood should have its own set of feeding implements which are washed and sterilized between feedings. The person feeding the nestlings must exercise care to avoid any form of infectious contamination between the young birds. The use of a new pair of disposable gloves at each feeding of each bird is a reasonable precaution. Although the specific source of the papovavirus in a particular outbreak is rarely determined, circumstantial evidence suggests that eclectus parrots and certain conures of the genus Aratinga may play a carrier role in the spread of the disease. Of course, direct and indirect contact with breeding populations of budgerigars should be strictly avoided by the aviculturist rearing other species of parrots. ? DavidL.
