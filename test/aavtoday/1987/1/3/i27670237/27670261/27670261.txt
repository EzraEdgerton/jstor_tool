<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guidelines to Recognizing Potentially Smuggled Birds Susan Clubb, DVM Il nee again, retailers got caught ^ ^ in the "bargain nape" trap. Hand-fed, baby Yellow-naped Amazons are popular birds which usually carry wholesale price tags of $4504600 each. So in March, when a few established bird distributors offered bargain prices in the $300 range, pet retailers in 35 states quickly placed their orders. But it wasn't such a great "bargain." Just ask the shopowners in 10 of those states whose birds - inventory and personal pets ? were depopulated because many of the low priced napes had VVND (Newcastle disease). BUYER, BEWARE! You can protect yourself from being victimized. Just think about three things ? price, breeding season and bands ? before you purchase exotic birds. If you're offered baby napes or Mexican species (such as Double Yellow-heads, Mexican Red-heads or Military Macaws) at prices that are "too good to be true," go no further. Period. Realize that yellow napes are not easy to raise in captivity and are seldom raised in large numbers in the United States. The first eggs appear in most collections during February-March. Partially feathered birds ? incubated 30 days, then reared to 8-16 weeks of age ? would not logically be available until May. Furthermore, captive born napes are usually available in groups of one or four (the normal clutch size). In other words, if you're offered large numbers of marketable baby napes in March, they probably came from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras or Nicaragua (which have earlier breeding seasons). The word "smuggled" should immediately flash in your mind. If the birds are banded, you must be able to determine if the bands are legitimate. (If there are no bands at all, ask the seller to explain the source of the birds ? and be prepared to verify the information.) The USDA uses an easily recognizable code to identify legal bands. Birds from privately owned commercial quarantine stations will be wearing leg bands with an alphanumeric code ? three letters followed by three numbers. The first letter signifies the state in which the station is located: C = California F = Florida H = Hawaii I = Illinois L = Louisiana M = Michigan N = New York O = also California T = Texas The second letter is a code for the particular quarantine station (several of which may be operated by one importer). And the third letter is part of the individual bird's identification number. There are 26,000 different combinations of letters and numbers which may be used before a code is repeated. Birds from USDA-owned and operated quarantine stations will have bands with letters and three or four numbers. The letters refer to the location of the station: HH = Honolulu, HI 58A, 58B, 58C, 58D, 58E, 58F or USDA-F = Miami, FL NNY = Newberg, NY T = Key West, FL There are also nine USDA regulated pet bird quarantine stations. The letters on their leg bands refer to location and are followed by three or four numbers. That code is deciphered as follows: USDAB = Brownsville, TX USDAE = El Paso, TX USDAH = Honolulu, HI USDAL = Laredo, TX USDAA = Los Angeles, CA USDAM = Miami, FL USDANNY = Newberg, NY | USDAN = San Ysidro, CA Finally, there is one USDA quaratine station for birds which have been confiscated and put up for auction: USDAX = Mission, TX Bands may be open (there is a gap in the band) or closed. All quarantine bands are open. Closed bands are only put on baby birds which then grow into the ring. Young Amazons, as an example, are banded at approximately four weeks of age. By that time, however, many illegal napes are already in trade channels and have been * 'legitimized* ' with smuggler-applied closed bands. Unscrupulous suppliers can be quite clever; you should be quite careful. If you're offered "captive-born" napes in lots of six for $330 apiece, something is not right. Don't get caught in the trap.
