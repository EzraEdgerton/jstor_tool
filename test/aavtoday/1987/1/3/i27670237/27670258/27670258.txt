<plain_text><page sequence="1">Feeding Dog Food to Birds The use of dog or monkey chows or pelleted rations as the exclusive diet precludes the necessity of providing birds with a wide variety of foods and supplements with the hope that they will consume some of each of the offered items. It must be assured that such diets contain vitamin D3, the form required by birds. The author has maintained Amazon parrots (Amazona spp.), macaws (Ara spp.), conures (Arantinga spp., Cyanoliseus patagonus, and Pyrrhura frontalis), cockatoos (Cacat?a spp.), cockatiels (N. hollandicus), lovebirds (Agapornis spp.), budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus), Senegal parrots (Poicephalus senegalus), and monk parrots (Myiopsitta monachus) for periods of from three to eleven years and has bred budgerigars, cockatiels, Patagonian conures (C. patagonus), and sun conures (A. solstitialis) on a diet composed exclusively of dry dog foods. No evidence of nutritional disease has been observed in birds which have been maintained on dog food or monkey chow diets. ?David L.
