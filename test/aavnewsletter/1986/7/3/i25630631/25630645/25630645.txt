We plan to meet for dinner the third Wednesday of every month at a local restaurant. The first meeting was September 17 and was quite successful in terms of attendance (21) and positive feed back. The meetings are designed to facilitate the exchange of informa tion/ ideas and to help us get to know one another better. And, of course, an additional function will be to serve as a base from which to plan, arrange and organize the 1988 AAY Annual Meeting. The meetings are limited to veterinarians, veterinary students, and animal technicians. The format is informal and flexible, and topics of discussion will come from the "floor11. I hope to maintain the momentum of this group to keep in terest and attendance high. Other avian veterinarians in close proximi ty to each other may want to try a similar program. -- Taffl S. Tippit, DYM Houston, TX IM E 695 .. Client Policy for Surgical Sexing Procedures We encourage clients to be pre sent during surgical sexing proce dures performed on their birds. We spend a few minutes explaining what can be expected; then the client observes the procedure and can visu alize the gonads through the endo scope. This seems to increase client confidence 1n surgical sexlng and make them more aware of what the veterinarian is capable of doing under properly controlled circumstan ces. This also helps dispel myths that may have been circulating among pet shops or pet bird owners who have not had the privilege of observing the procedure. - Michael Taylor, DYM Toronto, CANADA 87</page><page sequence="2">IME 696 .. Sample Bird Shop Inspection Sheet We have been developing some guidelines for retail bird outlets in an attempt to educate the store personnel, raise the standards of management practices and elevate the awareness of the bird buying public. Although the following in spection sheet is subject to revi sion, it has been useful in outlin ing recommendations for change. One point is counted for each "yes" answer. In order to achieve MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS a bird shop should have 54 points (if a pelleted diet is fed exclu sively) or 59 points (for seed based diets). Any points over 70 would approach optional standards for the "ideal" bird shop.
