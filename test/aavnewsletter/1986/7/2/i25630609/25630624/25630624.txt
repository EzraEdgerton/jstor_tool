I'm very excited about the interest r\ / shown by your members. ^sj X I would like to welcome you all into the Association of Avian Veterinarians. Your participation in this or , Qy ganization can only improve avion medicine and our pro ^/ f ess ion tremendously. One of my major goals this year as President of AAV is to see the Assoc iat ion of Avian Techni cians develop into the strongest technician group in our pro fession. The AAV Board of D/rectors is united in strong sup port of your goals. There are many tasks ah&amp;ad of you that will require fulI par ticipation and long-term commitment of your entire membership. I would urge each and every one of you to contact Linda Harri son, who has been appointed by the Board to serve as the liai son between AAV and A A 9 or Lcni McEntee to find out what you car do to further strengthen your assoc iat ion. A special thanks is in order to Loni McEntee for her tireless efforts this year in organizing your assoc iat ion. Without her there would have been no Assoc iat ion of Avian Technicians. David McCIuggage, DVM AAV President What's Happening with A.A.T. Members in attendance at the Miami meeting voted over whelmingly to maintain the momentum of the Association of Avian Technicians and to hold a continuing education seminar in conjunction with the Association of Avian Veterinarians in Hawaii September, 1987. The Association of Zoo Animal Technicians will be invited to participate in the meeting. Although there will be some presentations by avian veterinarians, the intent is to have "Sharing Sessions" where technicians with avian experience will teach each other. If you plan to attend the Hawaii meeting, consider this a CALL FOR PAPERS Submit ideas and abstracts to the AAV Newsletter Office, 5770 Lake Worth Road, Lake Worth, FL 33463.</page><page sequence="2">Employment Opportunities For Avian Technicians (Send Resumes) Gary Gallerstein, DVM Acacia Animal Hospital 1326 West Mission Road Escondido, CA 92025 (619) 745-8115 Cathy A.

Technicians with experience pre fer Macchiavello1s stain because there is a very dramatic color differential with this stain. But Macchiavell 1s stain re quires citric acid as a decolo rizing agent, and it is easy to inadvertently overdecolorize the smear with this component. The Gimenez method is the simplest in relatively inexperienced hands, but preparation of the components is more complicated. In preparing impression smears for Chlamydia diagnosis, it is very important to fix the slides with heat rather than methyl alcohol or any other organic solvent. I suspect the staining procedure depends upon a lipid component to help retain the stain in the elementary bodies. If one uses a lipid solvent to fix the slide, nei ther the Gimenez nor the Mac chiavello method will stain ef fectively. -- Jack Gaskin, DVM University of Florida The only illustrated guide available tor avian hematology.
