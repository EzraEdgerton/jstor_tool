COMMENT ON MEXICO'S EXPORT STATUS In the March, 1983 A.A.V, Newsletter, a letter from Dr. Benjamin Lucio, the head of the Dept. of Avian Animal Produc tion (Medicine) at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City, expresses a sincere, justi fied concern for preservation of their native, particularly psit tacine, birds. The demand is such that the young fledglings are harvested from the nests in the wild and transported, in many cases illegally, to distribu tion points for sale in the Uni ted States and other countries. To preserve their indigenous species, restriction of imports into the U.S.A. by American authorities and other citizens is urged. Legal exportation of certain species from Mexico requires a permit. These are issued only during certain seasons of the year. At the time Dr. LucioTs letter was written, an attempt was being made to convince the Mexican officials that export permits should not be granted. Since about November 1982 or ear ly 1983, Mexican officials have refused to sign export certifi cates for certain species inclu ding yellow naped Amazon parrots. However despite this, the outbreak in parrots of Velogenic Viscerotropic Newcastle Disease (VVND) in New York and in Cali fornia in early April points up the difficulty of controlling importation from Mexico into the United States by legislation. For those of you old enough to remember, it's the old business of Prohibition and the eighteenth amendment to our Constitution. Where there is demand,it is filled legally or otherwise. Dr. Lucio's plea, in which he was joined by several other leading aviculturalists and vet erinarians in his country, is ex tremely worthy and the objective is valid. It is also my personal opinion that any attempts to embargo exportation or to pro hibit exportation simply will drive the price of the legal birds up that much more and of fer that much more financial in centive for illegal, unmoni tored importation to the U.S.A. This illegal importation poses a danger to our commercial poul try population in the United States; it also impacts on the companion bird industry very heavily with increased death losses and costs to legitimate importers, pet shops, and com panion animal dealers. Two al ternatives to embargoes or se vere restriction or prohibition of importation on the part of the receiving countries might be listed. How practical they are or how quickly they can be implemented obviously depends on many factors. One is to encourage con trolled production of these highly desireable pet and com panion birds in the areas of origin where climate and terrain favor their reproduction or in countries to which they are shipped. This requires long term development of information and its application for best results. The second and perhaps more immediately useful procedure is to reduce the costs and invest ment necessities for legal im portation and thus encourage controlled, monitored importa tion under optimum conditions of these species in the wild. Ob viously, this will require con siderable thought and collabor ation in order to maintain rea sonable safeguards against the importation of foreign animal diseases such as VVND or highly pathogenic influenza and to pro tect the domestic poultry as well as the companion bird pop ulation in this and other coun tries . - Dr. A.S. Rosenwald Extension Poultry Pathologist UC-Davis</page><page sequence="3">-37 IME 336 . . WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SUGGESTIONS I was most gratified to see the letter by Benjamin Lucio re garding the traffic in wild birds published in the pages of the A.A.V. Newsletter. I strongly believe that we veterinarians have a positive role to play in educating our clients in these concerns for wildlife conservation. I have found that most people are sympathetic to this problem and allow their choice of an avian pet to be guided toward those species bred in captivity such as cockatiels, budgies, doves, etc. There are, of course, individuals who insist upon taking a wild bird, that quitessential symbol of the freedom of wilderness, and making it a prisoner to his or her vanity. We can press for controls on this through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The U.S. attended that convention at the end of April. We can advocate controls on wildlife traffic as well as standards of humane shipping by writing to: Secretary of State George P. Schultz, 2201 C Street N.W. Washington, D.C. 20520. ? Basil P. Tangredi, D.V.M. Greenlawn, N.Y. 1 ME 337 . . USE OF CLAFORAN Claforan is an excellent broad spectrum antibiotic (3rd gen eration Cephalosporin). Because it is only specific against many gram negative pathogens, it can be used long term without fear of destroying the gram positive normal flora. We most often use it in combination with one of the aminoglycosides, which may be potentiated. I will use b.i.d. Claforan 50 mg/lb, along with Amikacin .01 mg/g s.i.d., Tobramycin .0025-.005 mg/g b.i.d., or gentamycin 1 mg/kg divided b.i.d. for 5 days, then re-evaluate the case. Polyuria should alert the clinician to po tential problems; use creatinines and uric acid readings as well. ? Walter J. Rosskopf, Jr., D.V.M. Hawthorne, CA IME 338 . . FLAGYL vs. TRICHOMONIASIS Flagyl (Searle) has proved a safe and efficacious drug for 2 cases of psittacine trichcmoniasis (Blue and Gold Macaw and an African Grey Parrot). The dose used was 62.5 mg/lb daily for 5 days, then every other day for 3 additional doses. The drug was administered directly into the crop by holding the jaws open with gauze loops. ? Walter J. Rosskopf, Jr., D.V.M. Hawthorne, CA IME 339 . . ADVERSE IVERMECTIN REACTION In regards to the use of Ivermectin in budgerigars with Knemidokoptic mange (A.A.V. Newsletter 3:4 77), a few budgerigars have reacted to the 200 ug I.M. injection of the drug. The birds show depression, ataxia, and mydriasis. The signs persist for 24 hours; however, the birds continue to eat and preen. The drug can be diluted with sterile water (not bacteriostatic water)</page><page sequence="4">-38 for injection or, according to the company representative, it is effective orally. Perhaps a lower dose can be just as effective to avoid side effects or an oral dose can be given. ? Terry W. Campbell, D.V.M. Kansas State University (Ed. note: The Newsletter received several reports of adverse reactions at that level of administration. In confirming the dose with the source, it was established that the drug used had been the research product. Susan Clubb reported her use of Ivermectin at the dose of 200 micrograms/kg in the March, 1983 Newsletter and maintains that no adverse reactions have occurred at that dose.) IME 340 . . INFRA-ORBITAL SINUS ASPIRATION To expand on IME 59, an in fra-orbital aspiration should be performed for the diagnosis of the causative agent in cases of sinusitis in birds. The pro cedure is the same as described by Lafeber for sinus infusion (Vet. Clin, of North Am. 3:2, 223, 1973). Material is aspirated from the sinuses using a sterile needle and syringe. A bacterial culture and antibiotic sensiti vity, mycotic culture, and cyto logical examination can be per formed. The advantage for doing this is to avoid surface organ isms that may outgrow the true causative agent on culture media as could be the case if the sam ple was obtained from the nares. Also, cytological evaluation can be helpful. A case in point involved an Amazon parrot with a chronic nasal discharge. The discharge was submitted for bacterial culture by swabbing the nares. A variety of organisms were isolated and the bird was placed on antibiotics accord ing to the sensitivity results. The bird did not respond after several months on antibiotic treatment. Finally, a sinus aspirate was performed and nu merous Cryptococcus neoformans yeasts were demonstrated on cytological examination and mycotic culture. The left and right infra orbital sinuses communicate in psittacine birds but not in passerines. It could be possi ble that different organisms could be involved in cases of bilateral sinusitis in passer ines. Therefore, aspiration of both sides would be indicated. ? Terry W. Campbell, D.V.M. Kansas State University IME 341 . . QUESTION REGARDING PARAKEETS Does anyone know what causes the condition in parakeets manifested by a unilateral rythmic jerking of a leg, wing, or both, and often the head and eyelids? It is very similar to chorea in a dog, I have seen several cases, all of which were on poor diets, so complex, A and D, and calcium were administered with no success and they eventually died. The last two cases were treated with Seletoc (.003 cc). The symptoms completely disappeared in both birds, but one, which received only 1 dose, died. The other bird was given 3 doses q.o.d. and survived. ? Helen E. Rider, D.V.M. Beaverton, OR</page><page sequence="5">-39 IME 342 . . TRANSMISSION OF POX Avipox is the largest virus particle so far known and is incapable of penetrating intact epithelium. Traumatic lesions (minor wounds) or vectors are necessary for the pox virus to overcome this barrier. In some countries pox is spread by mosquitoes which penetrate the epithelium. In the mosquitoes (salivary glands) the virus can survive (depending on the species) for 2-8 weeks. The spread within the flock is triggered by the close contact between the birds and the usual occurrence of the "peck order" which leads to the traumatic lesions. Improper cages or perches may also produce the lesions. You have to have the wound in.order to get the infection. Inhaling the dust will not transmit the virus. ? Dr. Helga Gerlach Mississippi State, MS IME 343 . . DIAGNOSIS OF POX Pox is diagnosed by histopathology or culture, either in embryonated chicken eggs or cell cultures. In culturing suspected material from psittacines, at least three passages are necessary in order to grow the virus for the development of CAM lesions. (The minimum number of passages for any pet bird virus is 3 - you have to allow for species differences.) In the laboratory, every egg should be opened, even if it doesn't die. Every embryo needs to be checked for changes ? it won't necessarily die every time it has a lesion. While the clinically leading symptom for pox in araazons is rhinitis, macaws have been diagnosed as having a similar pox virus - a non-cutaneous form - which causes a myodegeneration of the heart (the chick embryo developed necrosis of the heart as well, and early embryo death.) The virus has been identified by electron microscopy and serology. -- Dr. Helga Gerlach Mississippi State, MS IME 344 . . USE OF VIRA-A The use of Vira-A (anti-herpes ophthalmic ointment from Parke Davis) appears to be helping in some early cases of sus pected pox. While we've not confirmed the virus, the symptoms of blepharitis, epiphora, and blepharism (no oral or dermal lesions) have been seen primarily in amazons, particularly blue fronts, and have been unresponsive to antibiotics. The ointment is applied at least six times a day. ? Richard Woerpel, D.V.M. Hawthorne, CA IME 345 . . MANAGEMENT PROBLEM Two separate cases of Amazon parrots were recently presented with erythema and skin loss on the feet and legs. Blood tests and bacteriology revealed gram negative growth. The birds were only marginally responsive to antibiotic therapy. In desperation, thorough daily washing of cages, perches and food bowls was done. The lesions cleared in one week and have not returned, presumably caused by bacterial overgrowth in the cage. ? Jon F. Esposito, D.V.M. El Paso, TX</page><page sequence="6">-40 IME 346 . . RADIOGRAPHIC HINT Practitioners who have difficulty in obtaining consistent quality radiographs in bircfe should consider their developing technique. Automatic processing gives consistently good quality radiographs once the technique has been established. Hand de veloping is dependent upon so many factors that variation in the water temperature, mixing of solutions, etc. can cause enough variation to make an otherwise good radiograph non-diag nostic. ? Robert Altman, D.V.M. Franklin Square, N.Y. IME 347 . . PRELIMINARY T-4 STUDIES IN BIRDS While it is not without problems, preliminary results indicate the best available thyroid testing method in birds is the TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) response. The T-4 level is measured prior to the IM administration of 1 unit TSH per pound of body weight scaled down, and a second T-4 taken between 6 and 8 hours later. One would anticipate the stimulation of a func tional thyroid to cause a marked increase in the T-4 levels. The test does not work exactly the same in birds as it does in other animals. For one reason, the lower end of the T-4 levels for most laboratories is .5 and birds with values falling below this level (e.g., .1 for a budgie) are considerably less accurate. In addition, the TSH, being bovine in nature, is stimulating different types of amino acids in birds, there fore the dramatic triplication or quadruplication of the T-4 for normal organs in mammals does not occur. While the peak time is 16 hours in dogs, it seems to vary with the species of bird. There is indication that administration of other drugs interferes with the results of this test, as it does in other animals. ? Fred Soifer, D.V.M. Houston, TX IME 348 . . GIARDIASIS - ANTE MORTEM DIAGNOSIS While the presence of Giardia in a budgie flock with Budgeri gar Fledgling Disease (BFD) virus may double or triple the mortal ity expected from BFD alone, Giardia is not a severe pathogen on its own, but can act as primary Stressor to set the animal up for other diseases. One of the BFD-free control flocks we work with had no outside birds added for 20 years, was reproducing at an expected rate, yet was recently diagnosed as being Giardiasis +, with no clinical signs. It takes some experience to diagnose Giardia ante mortem. A wet cloacal swab on direct mount with a little saline will often exhibit the motion of the trophozoites which look similar to little spoons swimming around like tadpoles. According to Scholiens, New and Johnson (JAVMA, Vol. 180, No. 2, p. 170), "cysts of Giardia were easily recognized by their faint luminescence when the aperture of the condenser diaphragm of the microscope was nearly closed." -- Richard Davis, D.V.M. University of Georgia</page><page sequence="7">-41 IME 349 ? . GIARDIASIS - POST MORTEM DIAGNOSIS Giardiasis is a very common expectation in aviary budgerigars in southern California and should be suspect in looking at thin birds with wet tail feathers, and perhaps feces clumped on their feet. We maintained a colony of highly infested budgies for a year for research purposes. The birds were treated with Emtryl but the disease always recurred. We could tell by looking at them when they had it back - usually in about 6 weeks. On post mortem, the duodenal area had the typical yellow foamy, frothy contents and large numbers of the organism (with the characteristic double nuclei) could be seen on direct smear of a scraping of this area. The cyst is similar to the trophozoite in that it also has a double nuclei, but is more of a round shape instead of tear drop. There is some difficultly in distinguishing it from debris in a fecal. This Giardia was not characterized as to species, but attempts to transmit it to rodents failed. ? Kerry Mahoney, D.V.M. San Diego County Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory I ME 350 . LEUKOGRAM CAUTION Veterinary Reference Laboratory and other laboratories give normal leukocyte values listing the total leukocyte count ranges and the ranges for the relative percentages for each leukocyte in the differential. Caution should be used when evaluating the leukogram values based only on relative percentages. It was brought to my attention that an African Grey parrot having the following leukogram was diagnosed as having Lymphoid leukosis based on the relative lymphocyte count: Total WBC [x 103/mm3] = 3.36 Heterophils (%) = 11 Lymphocytes (%) = 84 Monocytes (%) = 4 Basophils (%) = 1 Eosinophils (%) = 0 ( 5 - 11)* (45 - 75)* (20 - 50)* ( 0 - 3)* ( 0 - 5)* ( 0 - 2)* *Normal values for African Grey Parrots (Veterinary Reference Laboratory) The bird was send home with a poor prognosis. However, if one looks at the absolute values and compares them to the normal absolute ranges, then the leukogram actually shows a leukopenia, heteropenia, and a normal absolute lymphocyte count: 3.36 ( 5 -11 )** 0.37 2.83 0.14 0.03 0.00 Total WBC [x 103/mm3] = Heterophils [ Lymphocytes [ Monocytes [ Basophils [ Eosinophils [ (2.25 - 8.25)** (1.0 - 5.5 )** ( 0 - 0.33)** ( 0 - 0.55)** ( 0 - 0.22)** ** Normal absolute values for African Grey Parrots calculated from Veterinary Reference Laboratory values. I have calculated the normal ranges for the absolute leuko cyte values from data issued by Veterinary Reference, Inc. These values were obtained by multiplying the lowest percentage to the lowest total leukocyte value and the highest percentage to the highest total leukocyte value for each leukocyte in the hemogram. ?

NOTES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE DISEASES OF ZOO AND WILD ANIMALS For twenty-five years, Eur opean colleagues have held sym posia on the diseases of zoo and wild animals. This gathering of veterinarians, wildlife biolo gists, zoo curators and zoo dir ectors has provided a forum for scientific and philosophical discussions that have far reach ing effects. In recent years, a few Americans have availed them selves of this opportunity to meet new colleagues and hear of some of the good work that is being done in Europe. American cage-bird practitioners should be aware that there are several outstanding avian clinics and research centers in Europe. The general theme of this year's symposium was avian medi cine. Although a proceedings of the symposium is published before the meeting, it is rarely cir culated in the pool of literature available to Americans. A few thoughts on some of the papers given and pearls picked up in conversations may be of interest. The X-ray was conceived and developed in Germany. European radiologists and avian practi tioners are using contrast radi ography in small birds. Uro graphin contrast media is given intravenously to delineate and evaluate the kidneys and intra abdominally into the air sac to outline tumors, enlarged spleens and gonads. Also, the air sac may be ex panded by the injection of air via needles into the air sac. This also outlines abdominal vis cera more fully than by simple inspiration (if that can be ac curately timed). A paper from British veter inarian Join Cooper appeared in the proceedings, but was not pre sented. He outlined an experi ment which corroborated clinical impressions that intramuscular injections may damage muscles. He has determined that antibi otics preparations using poly vinylpyrrolidone as the vehicle are less irritating than those using propyleneglycol. Veterinarians from the Avian Institute at Munich have been studying lead poisoning in birds, particularly raptors. A highly significant finding from their experiment indicates that birds can develop poisoning from lead particles in muscle. They have shown progressive e rosion of lead particles in tis sues with concomitant elevation of blood, liver, and kidney lead values. The birds even exhib ited clinical signs. This is highly significant to those working with rehabilitation centers. Dr. Lowenstine, from Davis, California, reported on a series of cases of papillomatous les ions of the feet of cockatoos which seem to contain herpes like virus particles. This adds another to the list of skin conditions from which viruses have been noted. A causal re lationship has not been proven at this point. Dr. Montali, from Washing ton, D.C., reported on experi ences with avian tuberculosis. Those serving large aviaries or zoo collections should take note. Constant surveillance was ne cessary to minimize the impact of tuberculosis. It is unlikely that the microorganisms can be eliminated from the environ ment but the number of organ isms in the soil and cages can be decreased by replacing soil periodically, continuous sani tation and periodic disinfec tion with phenolic products (orthophenyl phenol).</page><page sequence="9">-43 Another point he stressed was a thorough necropsy of all dead birds. The lesions of tu berculosis in birds may not be the classical granulomatous tu bercle. Secondary infections may mask the underlying problem. An additional diagnostic procedure used to screen birds is the lymphocyte transformation test which has more specificity than tuberculin testing, clini cal examination or hematology. Yersiniosis (Yersinia pseudotuberculosisl is an u com mon infection in caged birds, but veterinarians serving avi aries with outdoor facilities should be aware of the infection. Microbiological and detailed histotogic studies are necessary to differentiate Yersiniosis from tuberculosis. Vaccines are being used in Europe because of the severity of the problem in some zoo avi aries. Rodents and wild birds have been shown to be a reservoir for Yersinia. Professor Ippen, from East Berlin, reported on the inci dence of histomoniasis in over three decades of bird necropsies. In addition to gallinaceous birds, he directs our attention to ra tites and bustards. He further reported that concomitant para sitism with Heterakis gallinae is not necessarily present. He feels that careful microbiolog ical examination should be car ried out on suspected cases, be cause he has seen mixed infection with Candida albicans. Experienced practitioners have been frustrated by cases of beak necrosis. Dr. Kummer feld, a German colleague, re ported on beak deformities in Stanley cranes with an apparent parasitic invasion of beak tis sues involving a nematode (pos sible oxyspiruids). Concomitant bacterial and fungal infections contributed to the devitalizing process. Dr. McDonald from the Brookfield Zoo, Chicago, re ported on his work with lead poisoning in cockatiels. He will undoubtedly report his findings in more readily accessible lit erature. His report is sig nificant, because no similar study has been conducted on psittacine birds. Dr. Graf, from Budapest, reported on a group of pen guins that died from sodium chloride poisoning from eating fish that had been thawed for hours in a saline solution. This should remind us all that the salt gland must be kept toned up to function properly. In its natural environment, the penguin salt gland can cope, but manipulations in the captive environment can negate nature's tools. ? Murray E. Fowler, D.V.M. University of CA - Davis ******* IME 352 . . MICROSURGERY MODI FIED An adaptation of micro surgery can be performed using the fiberoptic endoscope as the source of light and magni fication. Wolf has a Flex-arm that will hold the scope in position, leaving your hands free for the surgery. Using this system with the electro surgical unit, I have success fully performed even hyster ectomies on budgies. While the operating distance is very short, it gives you a feel for what would be possible with an operating microscope. With the magnification, you certainly notice the very first drop of blood as it starts to form. ? Greg J. Harrison, D.V.M. Lake Worth, FL</page></plain_text>
