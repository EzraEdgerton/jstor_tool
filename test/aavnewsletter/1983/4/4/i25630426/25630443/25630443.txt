SOLID FOOD REQUIREMENTS AND WATER TOLERANCE OF COCKATIEL CHICKS FROM HATCHING TO FIVE WEEKS One method of increasing the production and quality of birds is to remove eggs from the nest, incubate them artificially, and rear the chicks by hand. The management and the nutritional require ments for the hand rearing of chicks are poorly understood. One of our research projects was to determine the water and solids require ments of cockatiels from hatching to weaning, which may serve as a model for hand rearing of other psittacine birds. The data obtained in the experiments established that solids and water requirements of cockatiel chicks change with age. Chicks became less tolerant of high levels of water in the diet at about two weeks of age. Between hatching and four days of age a diet of 5% to 6.7% solids was satisfactory for cockatiel chicks. Diets of 10% solids or more resulted in increased mortality between hatching and four days compared to 5% and 6.7% solids. A diet of 10% solids or less caused mortality that began at 16 days and continued through wean ing. From four days to weaning, cockatiels survived and grew well on diets of 20% or 30% solids. ?CR.

HYPERVITAMINOSIS-D IN NESTLINGS Recognition of the possible disastrous effects of deficiencies of calcium and Vitamin D leads some aviculturists to err in the opposite extreme. Although oversupplementation with calcium has not been shown to adversely affect nestlings, the same cannot be said for feeding excessive amounts of Vitamin Dg. Hypervitaminosis-D causes calcification in a variety of tissues and organs, rarely de tectable at gross examination but easily seen histopathologically. ? David L.
