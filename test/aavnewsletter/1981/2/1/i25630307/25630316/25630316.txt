<plain_text><page sequence="1">STATUS OP PACHECO'S VACCINE Three,-separate research facilities have independently developed an inactivated vaccine for psittacine herpesvirus infection (Pacheco's Disease), unaware of the others' projects at the time of onset. In the American Journal of Veterinary Research, Vol. 41, No. 8, S.B. Hitchner, V.M.D., and B.W. Calnek, D.V.M., M.S. describe the inactivated emulsified vaccine for a herpesvirus infection developed by them and tested on budgerigars at Cornell University. It remains to be determined what dose will be required for larger psittacines. Exposure challenges were administered IM, resulting in exposure more severe than by natural routes, however serving as a good indicator of an effective vaccine. Since Drs. Hitchner and Calnek are only involved in the research aspect of it, any production of the vaccine would have to come from a commercial source. The December 1980/January 1981 issue of Bird World published a paper on Pacheco's vaccine by J.M. Gaskin, D.V.M., D.A. Arnold and CM. Robbins of the University of Florida, which was presented at the 1980 annual meeting of the American Association of Zoo Veter inarians. According to Dr. Gaskin, the immunized Quaker parakeets have survived challenges to the immunity up to 10 months from time of vaccination. This research project was started with a grant from a private bird wholesaler. At the present time, the funds have been depleted, and there are no plans to market the product. Dr. David Graham, working first with a grant from the International Bird Institute, and now with out of pocket funds, developed a killed Pacheco's vaccine at Iowa State University. His work has not yet been published, but challenges at 3 weeks after vaccination have proven its effectiveness.</page></plain_text>
