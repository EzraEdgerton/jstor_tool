It can be made of leather or plastic; if made of plastic, rough up the areas to be glued with velcro cement with emery board first. ? Chuck Galvin, D.V.M. Petaluma, CA IME 432 . . USE OF THE FOCUSCOPE FOR TEACHING (Regarding IME 366 &amp; 410) In a teaching situation, I have found the Focuscope to be a useful instrument for demonstrating the techniques of surgical sexing to veterinary students, using adult pigeons and five-week old chickens as the laboratory birds. Although I don't have extensive experience in using it in other species (except a few hawks and.large amazons), for my purposes the light source, trocar and sleeve device are preferred to an otoscope and the magnification is ample for the conditions under which I use it. -- Richard Davis, D.V.M.
