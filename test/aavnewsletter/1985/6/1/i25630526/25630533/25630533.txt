<plain_text><page sequence="1">Import Forum This Forum was proposed by Robert Groskin, Social Action Chairman, to provide the opportunity for AAY mem bers to express points of view asso ciated with the capture and importa tion of wild birds into the U.S. AUSTRALIAN VIEWPOINT As an Australian AAV member I feel I must comment on the issue of the legal trading of wild birds. Those arguments in support of legal trading include: - there would be an increase 1n the governmental control and regula tion in this activity. - this governmental activity may identify illegal operations Involving protected wildlife and other unre lated activities, e.g. drug smug gling. - the populations of some wild birds which are pests to landowners may be controlled by an increase 1n regulated trading. - aviculturlsts would have broa der markets for their products. Those arguments against legal trading include: - there is the strong possibili ty that there may be substitution of the (common) species permitted to be traded with a rarer, more valuable specimen. Custom Officers do not have the expertise to Identify wild life, leading to the possibility of successful smuggling of endangered species. - the legal import of a few valuable (rare) birds is sure to lead to an Increase in the number of buy ers wanting these rare birds, with consequent pressure on wild popula tions. - legal trading seriously in creases the risk of disease Introduc tions, particularly virus diseases. Quarantine and transport facilities are rudimentary in many countries, and most are not equipped to handle birds, particularly for health checks. The Australian Government is currently reviewing whether it will allow legal export of its native birds to the USA and elsewhere. The decision however, is likely to take some time.
