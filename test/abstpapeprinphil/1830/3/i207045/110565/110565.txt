<plain_text><page sequence="1">" On an improved mode of constructing Magnets." By James Cunningham, Esq., Member ofthe Cork Seientific and Literary So? ciety. Communicated by North Ludlow Beamish, Esqs, F.R.S., President of that Society. The material recommended by the author for the most economical, as well as effectual method of constructing magnets, is cast iron, which should be formed in small castings in the form of a horse-shoe, each weighing about seven ounces; these he finds, on being touched in the usual manner by a small compound magnet, received and re? tained the impregnation better than any which he had previously constructed of steel. The Society then adjourned over the long vacation, to meet again on the 16th of November next.</page></plain_text>
