<plain_text><page sequence="1">326 March 12, 1835. The Rev. PHILIP JENNINGS, D.D., Vice-President, in the Chair. Continuation of a former paper " On the twenty-five feet Zenith Telescope, lately erected at the Royal Observatory ; " by John Pond, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal. For determining the place of any star passing the meridian near the zenith, at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, three different me? thods may be employed : first, by means of the mural circles ; se- condly, by the zenith telescope, used alternately east and west; and lastly, by means of a small subsidiary angle, as described by the au? thor in a former paper. The details of computations made according to each of these three methods are contained in the present paper; from which it appears that they all give results nearly identical; and that, when the observations with the two circles are made with suf? ficient care, the greatest error to be apprehended does not exceed the quarter of a second.</page></plain_text>
