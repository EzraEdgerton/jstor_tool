adjourned over the	1
analytically by means	1
and of those	1
any given order	1
are expressed in	1
are given analytically	1
are of great	1
as deserving attention	1
as the theorems	1
astronomy by the	1
attention the society	1
author considers them	1
by means of	1
by the same	1
by the squares	1
by their first	1
coefficients of the	1
coefficients of those	1
coefficients ofthe inequalities	1
coefficients ofthe terms	1
considers them as	1
corresponding to any	1
deserving attention the	1
developing the disturbing	1
dis turbing function	1
disturbing func tion	1
eccentricities and of	1
eccentricities are given	1
example the coefficients	1
expressed in terms	1
first powers as	1
for example the	1
func tion in	1
function multiplied by	1
given analytically by	1
given of developing	1
given order are	1
gives rise are	1
great simplicity the	1
in physical astronomy	1
in terms of	1
in the dis	1
in this paper	1
in which the	1
independent of the	1
inequalities corresponding to	1
inferior orders so	1
is given of	1
long vacation to	1
means of the	1
method gives rise	1
method is given	1
multiplied by the	1
multiplied by their	1
of developing the	1
of great simplicity	1
of the coefficients	2
of the eccentricities	2
of the inferior	1
of those independent	1
of those multiplied	1
ofthe inequalities corresponding	1
ofthe terms in	1
order are expressed	1
orders so that	1
over the long	1
paper a method	1
physical astronomy by	1
powers as the	1
researches in physical	1
rise are of	1
same in this	1
simplicity the author	1
so that for	1
society then adjourned	1
squares of the	1
terms in the	1
terms of the	1
that for example	1
the 15th of	1
the author considers	1
the coefficients of	2
the coefficients ofthe	2
the dis turbing	1
the disturbing func	1
the eccentricities and	1
the eccentricities are	1
the inferior orders	1
the long vacation	1
the same in	1
the society then	1
the squares of	1
the theorems to	1
their first powers	1
them as deserving	1
then adjourned over	1
theorems to which	1
this method gives	1
this paper a	1
those independent of	1
those multiplied by	1
tion in which	1
to any given	1
to the 15th	1
to which this	1
turbing function multiplied	1
vacation to the	1
which the coefficients	1
