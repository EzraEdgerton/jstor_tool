In this Paper a method is given of developing the disturbing func? tion, in which the coefficients ofthe inequalities corresponding to any given order, are expressed in terms of the coefficients of the inferior orders ; so that, for example, the coefficients ofthe terms in the dis? turbing function, multiplied by the squares of the eccentricities, are given analytically by means of the coefficients of those independent of the eccentricities, and of those multiplied by their first powers. As the theorems, to which this method gives rise, are of great simplicity, the author considers them as deserving attention. The Society then adjourned over the Long Vacation, to the 15th of November.</page></plain_text>
