The following Gentlemen were, by ballot, elected Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts on the part of the Society, viz.: George Biddeli Airy, Esq., A.R.; John Bostock, M.D.j the Rev. George Peacock, M.A.; Wiliiam H. Pepys, Esq.; and the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, M.A. " Researches in the Integral Calculus." Part II. By Henry Fox Talbot, Esq., F.R.S. Having explained, in the first part of his paper, a general method of finding the sums of integrals, the author proposes, in the second place, to apply this method to discover the properties of different transcendents, beginning with those of the simplest nature. With this view, he first shows its application to the arcs of the circle and the conic sections 5 and demonstrates the possibility of finding three arcs, such that, neglecting their signs, the sum of two of them shall be equal to the third, though not superposable in any part: an equality which has been hitherto deemed impossible in the ellipse and hyperbola, without the addition of some algebraic quantity. At a Special General Meeting of this Society, held after the or? dinary Meeting of the 17th of November, to consider of an Address to H.R.H. the President, on the happy recovery of his sight, It was Resolved unanimously, That this meeting feels great pleasure in con- gratulating H.R.H. the President of this Society, on the happy re- storation of his sight, a blessing which they sincerely hope he may long enjoy for his own happiness and for the benefit of science.</page></plain_text>
