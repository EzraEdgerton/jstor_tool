By G. H. S. Johnson, M,A.,Tutor of Queen's College, Oxford. Communicated bv the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S. Peculiar difficultv has hitherto attended the determination of the</page><page sequence="2">325 equation of the curve formed by the perpetual intersection of rays, which, diverging from a luminous point, are reflected by a polished surface of a given curvature. Curves of this description have been denominated caustics 3 and the method usually employed to discover their polar equations, or the relation between the radius vector of any point of the curve and the tangent at that point, is both long and in- elegant, and is considered by the author as involving considerable inaccuracy of reasoning. He proposes, therefore, tosubstitute a new method of investigation, by taking the polar equation of one of the reflected rays, and differentiating this equation with respect to the arbitrary quantities solely which determine its position, and thus ob- taining the polar co-ordinates of the point of intersection of two con- secutive lines 3 and finally, by elimination, the equation of the curve in which all such points are found. He is thus led to results remark? able for their simplicity, elegance, and generality: and he gives par? ticular applications of his method, exemplifying the facility with which it effects the solution of problems extremely difficult of management by the ordinary methods hitherto employed. His method is also ap? plicable to the determination ofthe equations of the evolutes of curves, and to various other problems of a similar nature.</page></plain_text>
