<plain_text><page sequence="1">A paper was then read, entitled, "On the supposed Powers ofSuc- tion of the Common Leech." By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq., F.R.S., President ofthe Horticultural Society. From observing the feebleness of the muscular force exhibited by the leech in its progressive movements through the water, the author was led to doubt its possessing the powers of suction that are so uni? versally ascribed to it. A fact which came under his notice above sixty years ago, of considerable loss of blood from the leg following the bite of a vigorous leech, suggested to him the idea that the animal might become filled with blood simply by the injection of its body, in consequence ofthe impetus with which the blood is made to flow into it from the part bitten ;?an impetus which he imagines may be oc? casioned by the introduction of a peculiar kind of venom. He con? siders the irritation which often accompanies the bite of a leech as corroborating this hypothesis : he admits, however, that the inflam? mation excited by the sting of a bee or a wasp is attended with effects of a totally opposite kind; for, in that case, the blood, instead of having a tendency to flow, stagnates around the point where the poison has been instilled.</page></plain_text>
