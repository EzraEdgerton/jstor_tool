N., was balloted for, and duly elected into the Society. A paper was read, entitled, " On a new equi-atomic compound of Bicyanide with Binoxide of Mercury." By James F. W. Johnston, Esq., F.R.S. In this paper an account is given of the properties of a salt, ob? tained by agitating with red oxide of mercury a small proportion of hydrocyanic acid, and which the author finds to be distinguished from the bicyanide of mercury by its sparing solubility in cold water, by the strong alkaline reaction exhibited by its solution, (a property which indicates an excess of mercury,) and by its susceptibility of detonation by heat, depending on this excess being in the state of an oxide, and on the action of the oxygen on a portion of the car? bon of the cyanogen it contains, and the presence of which is shown by the disengagement of hydrocyanic acid gas when acted on by hydrosulphuric and hydrochloric acids. The analysis of this salt, given by the author, shows it to con? sist of Carbon. 5*203 Nitrogen. 6*025 Oxygen . 3*098 Mercury. 85*674 100. The formula of which composition is as follows: Hg. Cy.,. + Hg. 0.2.</page></plain_text>
