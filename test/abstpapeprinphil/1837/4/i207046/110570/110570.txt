Tables are subjoined, containing the dips ob? served at each place; the times of making a hundred vibrations of live horizontal needles, and the mean horizontal forces computed therefrom ; and likewise the results estimated in the direction of the dipping needle, compared with direct experiments made with the dipping needle itself. A paper was also read in part, entitled " On Low Fogs and Sta- tionary Clouds." By William Kelly, M.D. Communicated by Capt. Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.</page></plain_text>
