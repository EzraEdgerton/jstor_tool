Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S., &amp;c. The hypothesis advanced by the author in explanation of the well- known partial absence of the coloured pigment or rete mucosum, in dif? ferent parts of the human body, and that of other animals, is that it is due to the union or adhesion of the epidermis and the true skin, so as to exclude the rete mucosum. He supports this hypothesis by the analogy of a cicatrix, which is the result of an organization of a</page><page sequence="2">166 certain portion of lymph, poured out from the cut surfaces of a wound, as part of the process of nutrition, or as the consequence of a small amount of infiammation, induced either from mechanical irritation, or other accidental circumstance. This hypothesis was suggested by the colourless appearance of the cicatrix from the section of the umbilical cord in the negro, and also of that seen by the author at the umbilicus of the bottle-nosed whale, the Hyperoodon bidentatus. The Society then adjourned over the long vacation to meet again on the 21st November next.</page></plain_text>
