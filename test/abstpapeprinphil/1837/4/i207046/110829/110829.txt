<plain_text><page sequence="1">" Observations on the relation which exists between the Re- b2</page><page sequence="2">474 spiratory Organs of Animals, and the preservation of independent Temperatures." By George Macilwain, Esq., Consulting Surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary. Communicated by Wiliiam Lawrence, Esq., F.R.S. The author expresses his dissent from the prevailing opinion that the temperature maintained by animals above the surrounding medium is proportionate to the extent of their respiration; and ad- duces many instances among different classes of animals in which he can trace no such correspondence, and others, on the contrary, where increased powers of respiration appear to diminish instead of raising the animal temperature. Hence the author is disposed to regard respiration as a refrigerating rather than a heating process. The Society then adjourned over the long vacation, to meet again on the 16th of November next.</page></plain_text>
