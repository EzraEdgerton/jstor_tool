Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Pro? fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford. This paper contains an experimental investigation of the pheno? mena of elliptic polarization resulting from the reflexion of polarized light from metallic surfaces, and the theory on which they are ex- plicable ; the analytical results being given in a tabular form, and applied to the cases of the experiments themselves.</page></plain_text>
