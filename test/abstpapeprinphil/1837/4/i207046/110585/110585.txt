<plain_text><page sequence="1">March 22, 1838. FRANCIS BAILY, Esq., V.P. and Treas., in the Chair. A paper was read, entitled, " Description of a new Tide-Gauge, constructed by T. G. Bunt, and erected on the Eastern bank of the River Avon, in front of the Hotwell House, Bristol, in 1837." Communicated by the Rev. Wiliiam Whewell, M.A., F.R.S. The principal parts of the machine here described, are an eight- day clock, which turns a vertical cylinder, revolving once in twenty- four hours ; a wheel, to which an alternate motion is communicated by a float rising and falling with the tide, and connected by a wire with the wheel which is kept constantly strained by a counterpoise; and a small drum on the same axis with the wheel, which by a sus- pending wire communicates one 18th of the vertical motion of the float to a bar carrying a pencil which marks a curve on the cylinder, or on a sheet of paper wrapped round it, exhibiting the rise and fall of the tide at each moment of time. The details of the mechanism, illustrated by drawings, occupy the whole of this paper.</page></plain_text>
