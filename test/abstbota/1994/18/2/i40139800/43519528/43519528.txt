A semiautomatic procedure is proposed as a helpful tool for structuring vegetation data tables. Data analysis and typical procedures used for this purpose are discussed in the context of the theoretical steps involved, and an example is shown. 1. Introduction Structuring a vegetation table is often the synthesis of long field work, performed by a plant community scientist, in order to know both the vegetation structure of his study area and the environmental factors that may be considered responsible for the origin of com- munity differentiation. In other cases, the vegetation table is assembled from different published tables (or parts of tables), with the aim to get some more general knowledge of communities distributed in a larger en- vironment. In both cases, four major targets may be outlined: (1) the grouping of releves having a similar structure in terms of plant species presence; (2) the grouping of species according to their associa- tion ability; (3) the correspondence between the two partitions and the identification of syntaxonomical units; (4) the identification of environmental factors that may cause the diversity of the releves. Several techniques were developed in the past, for structuring vegetation tables. Classical data analysis procedures may be found for this purpose in the statis- tical computer programs, whereas in the most special- ized packages many non-standard analyses are available in order to improve the structuring results. In previous papers (Camiz 1988, 1991, 1993a) different methods were reviewed, general problems were dis- cussed, and computer assisted procedures were out- lined, which may help vegetation scientists to structure their tables, minimizing the need of data analysis knowledge and computer practice. Based on MULVA-4 (Wildi &amp; Orlóci 1990), a very well-designed package for community data analysis, Wildi (1988, 1989) discusses in details some topics concerning table structuring practice and suggests methods to be used through MULVA-4 that may give optimal results. In the latter paper, Wildi uses Ellenberg 's grassland data set (Müller-Dombois &amp; El- lenberg 1974) for rearrangement by the proposed methods. In this paper a data analysis procedure is described, based on Wildi' s package and the criteria proposed by Camiz (1988, 1991, 1993a). The underlying mathe- matical and data analysis models are discussed, and the results of its application to Ellenberg' s data are shown. The results are similar to Wildi' s and, in some respect, even better with the advantage of a conceptually simpler model. 2. A research model It may appear as an author' s obsession to stress the dif- ference between the different steps of a research process and to suggest different approaches for each step. In fact, only the knowledge of such steps may in- dicate to the researcher the caveats to notice, par-</page><page sequence="2">58 Camiz: Structuring vegetation tables ticularly in data analysis, since different tools may be specific to a particular step, and they may not be used in the others without care. The steps, as proposed in Camiz (1993b) may be defined as follows: (1) Exploration phase , in which one defines a frame of reference for his/her work, defines the research purposes, and begins the collection of data. In this phase, data are submitted to ex- ploratory data analysis to recover as much syn- thesized information as possible, in order to reveal any existing data structure and, in par- ticular, to see whether or not the research aims are reachable on the basis of the collected data. (2) Knowledge acquisition phase , in which the information obtained by the previous analysis is used in order to improve the experimental design, to clarify relationships among measures and among observations. In this phase, a confir- matory analysis is applied to the data, in order to figure out the assumed relationships. Sam- pling requires particular care to make statistical inference from the results on the reference population, and statistical techniques are used to reveal the significance of relationships detected. (3) Modelling phase , in which a theoretical and formalized (or mathematical) .description of an observed phenomenon is given, able of giving evidence of the relationships observed. In this phase, data must be used to test the effective- ness of the model, so that the most different data sets are used to evaluate its application range. Simulations may be considered to show the effectiveness of the model to depict the studied phenomenon, as well as forecasting, i.e. the ability of the model to predict the behaviour and the evolution of the phenomenon itself. It is the author's opinion that the rearrangement of a vegetation table does not belong by any means to the exploration phase of the investigation, at least as far as it is a part of phytosociology, where typification is the major aim and both sampling procedures and data coding are empirically defined (Camiz 1993b). Ac- tually, table structuring is performed in order to reveal the table structure and in particular to identify the dif- ferent syntaxonomical units to which the relevés may be attributed, and to suggest the existence of possible environmental factors, through the inspection of the table itself. However, statistical tests are usually not performed on the results, nor were models attempted so far by researchers, trying to represent in detail the relationships actually existing between species abun- dance and environmental gradients. However, it is true that a long-lasting discussion oc- curred among vegetation scientists in order to raise the degree of precision of the results, often biased by the limits of the methods used, since the relationship bet- ween species abundance and environmental factors is non-linear but at least unimodal (Gauch et al. 1974, Austin 1976, to quote only some). Thus, linear methods, such as those usually employed in ex- ploratory analyses, are inadequate to satisfy the idea of finding both relevé optima and species optima exactly ordered along unmeasured environmental gradients. Whereas it is evident that this may not be the object of an exploratory analysis, but rather a final result, at- tempts were made in this direction, ranging from manipulations on already existing techniques (Hill &amp; Gauch 1980, ter Braak 1985) to the development of al- ternative methods, based on different data models, as in Ihm &amp; van Groenewoud (1984) or in Goodall &amp; Johnson (1987). Although very much attracted by some of them, the author admits his insufficient ex- perience so that he needs some more practice before being able to discuss both these methods and their results. Nevertheless, it is claimed that exploratory data analysis, if kept within its actual frame and care- fully inspected, provides fully acceptable results. 3. A basic data analysis method A basic exploratory data analysis procedure may be described as follows: (I) Use of either principal components or correspondence analysis , according to the kind of data table Principal components analysis (PCA) and correspon- dence analysis (CA) are well-known exploratory tech- niques to synthesize information in the data in spaces of reduced dimensionality (Lebart et al. 1977, Orlóci 1978, Legendre &amp; Legendre 1983). In this way, original variables are substituted by a reduced number of factors, which may be considered the main source of data variation. The underlying mathematical model considers the original variables as generators of a vec- tor space, sustaining the affine space of individuals (Bourbaki 1962, Goderrient 1966, Camiz 1991): in terms of vegetation data analysis each species is a vec- tor, the set of considered species spans a multidimen- sional space and each point in this space is a relevé. In this space relevé coordinates along each species vector correspond to species abundance and close relevés in this space have the meaning of having similar vegeta- tion. Both PCA and CA define a scalar product in this</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 18(1 994) 59 space, in order to work in a Euclidean space, in form of mutual angles of variable vectors, with the meaning of correlation among species. In this way, species vec- tors are oriented towards close directions if the species tend to be present in the same releves. Then the factors represent an orthonormal basis for this space, i.e. vec- tors mutually oriented at square angles, identifying groups of species with independent abundance, having in addition the property that each reduced p-dimen- sional subspace, whose basis corresponds to the first p factors, is the subspace of dimension p where the max- imum information is contained. In case of CA (that can be defined as a PCA of doubly standardized data, Benzécri 1973, Hill 1973, 1974, Orlóci 1978), an al- ternative model may be considered, i.e. the projection of two vector spaces, individuals and characters, into a subspace that best approximates both of them: in vegetation terms, each plant is considered according to either its species or the relevé it belongs to. It is then the agreement between these two criteria that is revealed by the analysis, so that both species and relevés may be represented simultaneously as points of geometrical spaces, whose position may be understood as similarity or correspondence. (2) The choice of a suitable number of axes, according to the amount of explained variance , and explanation of the meaning of axes The choice of the number of axes to take into account is discussed in the literature: the total amount of ex- plained variance, usually reported by computer prog- rams together with the eigenvalues, is a normal refer- ence. To limit attention to factors whose eigenvalues are higher than 1 is considered effective in standar- dized PCA, whereas in CA eigenvalues are always less than 1. Since in this case their square roots have the meaning of correlations between the corresponding factors, as seen by both individuals and characters, i.e. a measure of the correspondence between species and relevés, attention may be limited only to those factors showing a good correlation between the two sets. (3) Classification of the individuals according to their coordinates on the chosen axes through some hierarchical classification method Cluster analysis (CLA) (Anderberg 1973) is used to partition a set of individuals to homogeneous groups, so that, referring to group characters rather than to in- dividuals, a synthesis is obtained. Hierarchical cluster- ing methods give a complete taxonomie structure of the considered individuals, an advantage if there is no a priori knowledge of data structure. Individual coor- dinates on the axes reflect their position in the reduced dimensional space, so that only meaningful factors are taken into account by the classification. Distance (Euclidean, Manhattan, Chord) is normally used as a measure of proximity among individuals. The hierar- chical classification allows the choice of one or several specific partitions after the inspection of the dendrogram structure. The agglomeration criterion (single or complete linkage, Ward, etc.) depends large- ly on the researcher's choice. (4) Choice of suitable partitions The sequence of values of the objective function, taken into account by the agglomeration criterion at each step of clustering as fusion levels, may be used for the identification of the best partition. In fact, since for the mentioned criteria the sequence is monotonous, parti- tions followed by highest variations are considered generally more effective than the others. (5) Description of the clusters formed through their position along factorial axes or planes, or through the original values of variables Note that the description of group structure may usual- ly help in the interpretation of factors. The procedure of the analysis is considered successful if a small num- ber of axes represent a large portion of the total infor- mation, where the original variables are significant in the interpretation of factors, and most of them are saturated by factors, i.e. they are sufficiently well- represented by linear combinations of the considered factors. In addition, the subsequent classification reveals the optimum number of groups, harmonically characterized by both the original variables and the factors. Unfortunately, it may happen that the results are not so clear-cut, because either the data are simulated on pur- pose, or the structure is evident per se, although hidden by the chosen variables. Nevertheless, even if the results are normally less easy to understand, they may reveal a very suggestive data pattern after careful ex- amination, which can be further tested by a confir- matory analysis. 4. Structuring vegetation tables Structuring involves rearrangement of both table rows (species) and columns (relevés) in such a way that in the resulting pattern of blocks concurrent species scores are homogeneous for similar relevés, so that relevé groups can be easily typified. Theoretically, structuring is a combinatorial problem, since one could rearrange both relevés and species in all possible ways, and once a measure of goodness of structuration is defined, best solutions may be considered those cor- responding to the measured highest values. Unfor-</page><page sequence="4">60 Camiz: Structuring vegetation tables tunately, since a table usually concerns around 50-100 relevés and 100-200 species, and the number of pos- sible rearrangements is ni x mi , with n and m the num- bers of species and relevés, respectively, several billion years of computation for a medium size table would be required, not even considering all possible cross-partitions. A better approach is therefore to build a structured table according to some theoretical model that, even if leading to a sub-optimal solution though in human times, may give additional results useful for a better comprehension of the data structure. Multi- variate techniques used in exploratory analysis claim to extract the most interpretable part of information from the data. In particular, ordination reveals environ- mental gradients and classification detects the syntaxa. Actually, it is well known (Noy-Meir 1971, 1974) that for identification of phytosociological entities, PCA is useful, since these entities can be considered as linear combinations of co-occurrent species and the linear model is appropriate. But formally, a vegetation table can be considered a contingency table, since the score of a species in a relevé is a transformation of the num- ber of individuals, i.e. a frequency. For this reason, CA is considered more appropriate than PCA for the pur- pose, with the advantageous reduction of the horse- shoe effect (Guttman 1953), namely the distortion deriving from the non-linear relationship between species and environmental factors (Orlóci 1980, Fewster &amp; Orlóci 1983, Camiz 1991). The proposed data analysis procedure, whereas effec- tive for understanding most of the table structure, is not sufficient to provide a structured table. For this aim it should at least be completed with a clustering of species, in order to enable a rearrangement of both rows and columns. The procedure should also be in- tegrated by a test for the evaluation of the quality of the classifications found, enabling the user to choose among them. In order to evaluate the quality of the table structure, analysis of concentration (AOC) was developed by Feoli &amp; Orlóci (1979). It is a CA of the contingency table obtained by considering a cross-classification table, whose cell values are normalized. As a result, chi-square and mean square contingency coefficients are both tools for the evaluation of the correspondence between the two classifications. In addition, the square roots of eigenvalues are canonical correlations , i.e. correlations between the couple of factors, as seen by table rows and columns. This last information may be used to reveal the number of gradients that influence the table (those corresponding to high canonical cor- relations), so that it can play a central role in the two crucial decisions usually left to the user: the number of factors to choose and the best classifications. So, for structuring purposes, to ground a procedure on AOC, albeit including most of the exploratory procedure, can give more consistent results, even limiting the researcher's choices to the true minimum. 5. An exploratory procedure for structuring a vegetation table If one wants to ground the structuration procedure on AOC, it is most convenient to start with a CLA rather than with ordination, since in this way no information is lost before classifying. Instead, once determined through AOC the likely number of environmental fac- tors to be taken into account, one may look for them in the following CA. A second CLA should be performed based on CA results in order to base classification only on the information actually interpreted. The procedure suggested considers the data table only from the species presence/absence point of view, since the problems of density estimates, recoding, etc., are far from the aims of this study. It is then composed of the following steps: (1) Reduction of the table by eliminating the single-occurrence species The elimination of single-occurrence species helps reducing outlier relevés that may affect the results of CA (Wildi 1989, see Wildi &amp; Orlóci 1990, for adjust- ments); they can be added at the end through iden- tification methods. (2) Computation of a resemblance matrix between species , and between relevés The choice of resemblance measures depends strictly on the type of data, with attention paid to the coherence of the coefficients used in the computations of resemblances between relevés and species. Consider- ing only presence / absence data, simple coefficients of association may be used: given two relevés, the number of species present only in either relevé cor- responds to their squared Euclidean distance, and the number of relevés where two species are jointly present corresponds to a non-centred sum of squares, i.e. a scalar product: thus the two indices may be con- sidered coherent since both refer to the same affine space model of representation. Although the latter index was heavily criticized by Wildi (1989), both can be used in this step, since it is not a final classification. (3) Hierarchical clustering of species Complete linkage clustering is the method that ensures the highest within-groups coherence and can be used</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 18(1 994) 6 1 with scalar product values. Clustering fusion levels correspond to the least number of releves where two species of each group are joined. The last partition before the fusion level is zero gives the smallest num- ber of groups having the least internal coherence, with the advantage that the dendrogram can be rearranged in any order. This is useful for a provisional structured table, since the restriction to observe the dendrogram structure in the rearrangement is partially overridden. (4) Hierarchical clustering of releves "Minimum variance" clustering criterion (Ward 1963) is effective for distance indexes, giving compact groups similar to those resulting from complete linkage, useful for our purpose. In addition, the fusion level, corresponding to within-group sums of squares, may be easily interpreted. As a stopping rule, the in- spection of fusion level sequences may be used in con- junction with the two derivative sequences: the first corresponds to the differences of contiguous fusion levels, and the second corresponds to the differences of contiguous values of the first derivative. The best partitions may be considered those preceding local maxima of the first derivative sequence, since they are followed by the highest increases of variance, thus a reduced homogeneity in the following partition. A maximum is preceded by a positive value of the second derivative and followed by a negative value. To keep the number of relevé groups smaller than that of species groups usually enables to study each relevé group structure in terms of one or more species groups. (5) Analysis of concentration of all chosen cross-classifications In order to identify the likely number of gradients in- fluencing the relevé structure, one may examine the variation of AOC canonical correlation coefficients of the chosen cross-classifications. If the groups of species and releves are n and m, respectively, these coefficients are min (m,n) - 1. If a threshold value is fixed, one may consider to take into account an AOC factor if the canonical correlation coefficient is larger than the fixed threshold. Reviewing all analyzed cross- classifications, one may detect the maximum number of factors simultaneously larger than the fixed threshold and decide that this is the number of gradients influencing the relevé structure. A graphical representation of both species and relevé groups on factor spaces may provide a first idea of group patterns along hypothesized gradients. (6) Correspondence analysis of the data table Due to its particular model, the use of CA is of high interest: the theoretical model is close to AOC, and it can add more detailed information about the gradients, now considered at the individual level instead of the class level. The previous inspection on the number of gradients overrides the arch effect often present in CA, that usually biases their identification. After AOC, one may only verify if the results correspond to this previous choice, considering that, in this case too, the square roots of eigenvalues are canonical correlation coefficients. (7) Hierarchical clustering of both species and releves, based on CA scores The symmetry of species and releves in CA suggests now to use the same procedure described in (4) for both classifications. The new classifications take only into account the variability due to interpretable factors and are free from the previous classifications bias due to co-occurrent species: for this reason they may be considered more consistent than the previous ones, and in practice they usually give better results. The choice of Euclidean distance and minimum variance cluster- ing is consistent with the geometrical model of CA (8) Analysis of concentration of all chosen cross-classifications AOC canonical correlation coefficients can be used as a measure of goodness of block structure. An evalua- tion of the best cross-classification may be done, con- sidering that cross-classifications derive from a hierarchical procedure, thus they are hierarchically ar- ranged. This means that, given two cross-classifica- tions, one is always a refinement of the other. Consequently, the likely correspondence between groups of species and groups of releves increases with the number of both marginal partition groups. Let us consider two cross-classifications, being py coarser than p2 with qļ and q2 canonical correlation coeffi- cients respectively: if q' = q2i the coefficients values increase from pi to p2' if qi &lt; q2&gt; the first q¡ coeffi- cients of p2 may be compared to those of p' , but no certain relationship exists, unless some agreement, since there are new q2 - q¡ coefficients. In both cases the corresponding factors of the two cross-classifica- tions may be interpreted in a similar way, apart from minor rearrangements, rotations, etc. Thus, the best cross-classifications may be those having as many coefficients bigger than the threshold as identified gradients, but no other. Other AOCs can be performed in addition to verify the accordance of the new clas- sifications to the old ones, to check the consistency of the number of chosen factors, as well as the correspon- dence of factors to the canonical variates of AOC. A correspondence between these items would clearly in-</page><page sequence="6">62 Camiz: Structuring vegetation tables dicate a good fit between the techniques and eventual- ly a better reliability of the analytical results. ( 9) Rearranging the table The structured table may be rearranged according to the sequence of groups along the first axis of AOC, but observing the constraints of contiguity established by the dendrograms, and in each group rearranging items according to their position along the first axis of CA. The suggested rearrangements result in a very well structured table, better than that obtained using the first canonical variate scores only. For rearrangement, the use of a classification with a higher number of groups than the one actually considered as the best, may im- prove the results. 6. Application to Ellenberg's grassland data The discussed procedure was used by Pignatti et al. (1989) in order to classify European, in particular Italian, beech forests. The results were highly inter- pretable, confirming the hypothesis of a separate en- demic alliance of the Italian Peninsula, Sicily, and Corsica. The same procedure, with the same choices, was run on Ellenberg's grassland data, in order to compare the results with those shown by Wildi (1989). In par- ticular, 0.4 was chosen as a threshold value for canoni- cal correlation coefficients, a value based on the author's practice.

AOC results (Table 1) show a very reasonable 3x9 parti- tion: nevertheless, the increase of the second canonical correlation to .51 in 9 x 9 table suggests to consider two possible gradients, and the rearrangement of the table seems better in this way (Table 3.A), although it is evident from Fig. 3 that the second gradient seems due only to relevé 8 (group 3 of 9) and species 53, 54, and 56 (group 8 of 9).

The classifications performed after CA considering two axes, are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 (objects in dendrograms are again rearranged along the first axis of AOC): fusion levels and derivatives sequences sug- gest 3,5, and 7 groups for the relevés, and 5, 8, and 13 groups for species; analyses of concentration results (Table 2) suggest 7 x 13 as the best cross-classifica- tion, confirming two gradients. Actually, an inspection of the scatter diagrams of both AOC (Fig. 6) and CA (Figs. 7 and 8) shows an evident arch-effect, par- ticularly due to the two relevés 25 and 19 and species 76, 91, and 27 (groups 3 and 2 of 13 in Fig. 8.B), that only partially hide the possible second gradient. AOC does not help in revealing it, but it is visible in Fig. 8, where 4 species (76, 91, and 27 on the upper side, and 89 (group 13 of 13) on the lower side of second axis), very far from the centre, are represented on the graphic border in their correct direction, thus blowing-up the central part of the scatterdiagram.

Representation of relevé (R) and species (S) groups on the first two fac- tors of analysis of concentration of the 7 x 13 cross-classification based on cor- respondence analysis coordinates. Figures refer to the group numbers. The comparison of the grouping pattern of the two dif- ferent classifications of both relevés and species, per- formed on the plane of the first two axes of CA, shows how the classifications based on the presence / absence data table (Figs. 7. A and 8. A) result in a very compli- cated pattern, reflected by the aspect of provisional structured table (Table 3. A), very similar to the Wildi' s (1989) numerical solution, that he himself criticizes. Groups of the classifications derived from the chosen CA axes (Figs. 7.B and 8.B) are much more compact and well separated as compared to those in Fig. 7.A: one may argue that the first classification was in- fluenced by some information that CA did not take into account, thus probably irrelevant in connection with gradients detection. This is an important topic to be taken into account, since the final structured table (Table 3.B), shows clearly the improvement from the previous structuration, as well as the main gradient dis- cussed by Wildi (1989), and is in good accordance with both Ellenberg's and Wildi' s structured tables. In addition, it must be pointed out that the comparison of Figure 7. Representation of relevés on the first two factors of correspondence analysis. In (A) relevés are grouped according to the classification based on presence/absence data; in B) relevés are grouped according to the classification based on cor- respondence analysis coordinates.

In (A) figures are group numbers of classification in nine groups based on presence/absence data; in (B) they are group numbers of classification in 13 groups based on correspondence analysis coordinates (X = 10, A = 1 1, B = 12, C = 13). Four species very far from the center are represented on the border lines in their correct direction. this classification of releves with Ellenberg's one, through AOC, gives a mean square contingency coef- ficient of .793, even higher than the highest found by Wildi (1989). 7. Discussion and conclusions Both described procedures correspond to the present practice of exploratory data analysis and vegetation table structuring, and are based on methods largely known and experimented. Long experience with the MULVA-4 package, suggests that they are wonderful tools for vegetation table rearrangement. The procedure whose application is presented here was run using the latest release of MULVA-4 on PC/MS-DOS as a basis: only four steps needed special treatment, since the package does not provide the necessary computations: (a) the computation of first and second derivative of clustering fusion levels (to be included in program CLTR) that was performed through a spreadsheet program; (b) the computation of Euclidean distances based on CA coordinates, that needed complicated file manipulations (via EDCO, EDDA, a text editor, CREO and INIT): if only program RESE could use a chosen number of coor- dinates to build a resemblance matrix, instead of raw or transformed data, this task would become much easier; (c) the rearrangement by hand of objects in dendrograms according to coordinate scores: it should receive some special treatment, maybe in program CLTR, or in some other program, having stored some- where the original dendrogram. In addition, in order to improve the printout of this paper and similar reports: (d) the need to reverse upside-down some classifica- tions as well as some scatterdiagrams, in order to keep as much as possible the same ordinations in all tables and figures: this could be embedded in programs EDGR and ORDB without difficulties, whereas it had to be done either by hand or with a program written on purpose for the graphics. The procedure, as it is, provides a straightforward tool for a quick data exploration: the final choice about the true gradients and the effective cross-classification to take into account must be done based on experience in community studies, using arguments beyond the aim of this paper. It is evident that, after this procedure many other computations may help the user in under- standing trends in his data table, and still improve the presentation of the table, as Wildi (1989) shows using the same package. Nevertheless, the use of this procedure may help to speed up the process of table structuring considerably. References Anderberg, M. R. 1973. Cluster Analysis for Applications.
