Abstract This paper reviews the literature on the biology of clonal plants with emphasis on the ecological consequences of clonality at the community level. The hierarchical (genet-ramet) organization of clonal plants offers a variety of strategies in life history, resource use and space occupation that are specific to clonality. We present examples for particular clonal traits and their community level effects, as they appear from field studies and theoretical models. These examples suggest that clonality imposes strong constraints on spatial pattern and competitive relations in plant communities. However, clonality can also release constraints of species coexistence related to a trade-off between mobility and local persistence. We argue that a unique feature of clonal species is that they have internal (genet-level) control mechanisms on a spatio-temporal scale that is intermediate between the fine-scale (i.e. individual-to-individual) and the large-scale (i.e. population-to-population) interactions in a community. Therefore, the presence of clonal species in a community widens the scope of potential mechanisms of community organization. Introduction The success of clonality in the vegetation of the earth * is conspicuous . Most non-forest communities (like grasslands) are dominated by clonal species. Even in forests, dominant clonal plants may occur in any layer (e.g. moss: During 1990, herb: Angevine &amp; Handel 1986, scrub and tree: Jeník 1994). Clones interweave established, highly organized communities, and similarly successfully, pioneer at early successional stages (Prach &amp; Pysek 1994). They can dominate in a diversity of habitat types, including severely stressed (Callaghan et al. 1992a) or disturbed habitats (Sebens &amp; Thorne 1985). Many of the World's most wide- spread weeds are clonal (Cook 1985, Leakey 1981). The tendency of some vegetatively reproducing species to spread and locally dominate over large areas can be exemplified by a survey of the most widespread species in Britain (Bunce &amp; Barr 1988, cited in Cal- laghan et al. 1992b). The ten species that attained the largest estimated cover were all clonal. Their cover to- taled 19% of the area of Britain. Among these, Calluna vulgaris alone was estimated to extend over 1 .4 mil- lion ha. Salisbury (1942) estimated that two-thirds of the 260 most widespread species in Britain can reproduce vegetatively. Considering not only the most successful, but all clonal species, they were estimated to amount 70% of the species occurring in non-forest areas of the temperate zone (van Groenendael &amp; de Kroon 1990b). When studying community-level patterns or proces- ses, it is almost inevitable to encounter clones. However, the specific features of clonality have scar- cely been considered at the community level. In- dividual clonal species have been intensively studied * The present discussion will be confined to terrestrial habitats, and mostly to vascular plants.</page><page sequence="2">1 1 6 Oborny &amp; Bartha: Clonality in plant communities Table 1 (on opposite page). Examples about the role of clonality in plant communities. The first column lists some general traits that always (1 and 5) or often (2, 3 and 4) characterize plant clonality. These traits may enrich a plant's behavioral palette (2nd column), causing recognizable effects on its coexistence with other species. Potential effects in a community are considered on two scales: Local scale refers to the spatio-temporal scale of interactions of a ramet with its ecological neigh- bourhood (3rd column). Global scale is the scale on which patterns and processes of the whole community are considered (4th column). It is important to note that none of the specific traits and the effects are general for all clonal plants. Trends of their occur- rence are largely unexplored. Therefore, instead of providing a rigid framework, this table intends to show some connection points between clonality and community organization, which have been explicitely discussed or implicitely suggested in the literature.

The majority of the available data have been derived from greenhouse and garden experiments, and relatively lit- tle is known about these traits in natural habitats, as pointed out by de Kroon &amp; van Groenendael (1990), Herben et al. (1994) and Alpert (this volume). There is a gap in our understanding between the level of the in- dividual clones and the level of the plant community. In this paper, we list some potential links, that have been suggested in the literature (see Table 1), calling for a re-consideration of the significance of clonality in a community context. Clonal characteristics What is the origin of traits that are specific to clonal plants? In a clonal plant, a genetic individual (genet) can consist of several functional individuals (ramets) (Harper 1977, Jackson et al. 1985). Each ramet is potentially autonomous, being able to develop (at least, potentially) all the organs possessed by a whole plant. Thus, a single ramet isolated from the rest of the clone is comparable to an aclonal plant (cf. Tuomi &amp; Vuorisalo 1989). A ramet can be annual or perennial (see Cook 1985), herbaceous or woody (even a tree: Jenik 1992), similarly to aclonal plants. However, ramets are usually not isolated. Indeed, a genet can be highly organized both in a structural and in a function- al sense (see [2] and [3] in the next section). It is im- portant to realize that with the presence of a clone, a higher level of organization (i.e. the genet level) is present inNthe community (cf. Tuomi &amp; Vuorisalo 1989, Herben et al. 1994). The hierarchical organization of clonal plants has some obvious consequences on the scale of processes in a community. While the size and lifespan of ramets does not markedly differ from those of aclonal plants, the size and the lifespan of a genet can be extremely large. For example, a single genet of Gaylussacia brachycerium (box-huckleberry) has been reported to attain 1980 m in diameter, and 13 000 years of age (Wherry 1972). Herbaceous clones have also been found several hundred meters wide. Their estimated age could exceed 1000 years (e.g. Festuca rubra and Holcus mollis: Tab.8.1 in Cook 1985, Carexbigelowii : Jonsson in this volume). Apart from these peculiar Methuselahs of the Plant Kingdom, it can generally be stated that clonal plants escape the size and age con- straints of an aclonal plant (Harper 1985). In some species, the production of new ramets seems practical- ly unlimited through time (Watkinson 1988). In others, aging of genets occurs, but this process is very slow (Silander 1985). Only strong selection that affects all ramets at the same time can eliminate an established genet (Inghe 1989, Watkinson &amp; Powel 1993, see Tuomi &amp; Vuorisalo 1989 about hierarchical selection). The lifespan of a single genet can well be as long as the successional time of a whole community. Besides the big size and long survival of clones, there is another reason to consider larger spatio-temporal scales if a clonal species is present in an area. Com- munication between ramets of a clone can be very ex- tensive. Translocation of resources, photoassimilates and hormones within the clone, even between distant ramets, have been shown by a number of studies (for a review, see Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985, Marshall 1990, Kelly 1995). Integration of a clone results in "averag- ing" the environmental quality over large patches (Hartnett &amp; Bazzaz 1985, Eriksson &amp; Jerling 1990). This may strongly affect the genet's interaction with neighboring plants (see [3] below). In summary, clonal plants tend to perceive and respond to their environment on a larger scale than aclonal plants do. There are specific processes in a clone (con- cerning its pattern formation and resource use) that act on a spatio-temporal scale that is intermediate between the scale for an aclonal plant (or single ramet) and the scale for the whole community. These mid-scale processes will be reviewed in the next section (see columns 1 and 2 in Table 1). Concerning interactions with other plants in the com- munity, mid-scale behavior of a clone has effects in two directions. As a top-down effect, interaction of each ramet with its ecological neighborhood (cf.

As a bottom-up effect, genets may play specific roles in a community, con- cerning its coevolution, successional processes, stability, complexity, etc. (see the "community scale", column 4 in Table 1). Community organization Community theory aims to explain patterns of co-oc- curring species from underlying dynamic processes (Juhász-Nagy 1984, Palmer &amp; White 1994). Why has the importance of clonality been neglected so far in community theory? A primary reason could be a general delay in the appreciation of spatial effects, in particular, of scaling problems (Wiens 1989, Juhász- Nagy 1992, Podani et al. 1993). Classical community theories were based on a simplified conceptual framework, assuming continuity of space, spatial homogeneity of the environment and of the population densities (May 1973, Pianka 1981). The models were analogous to the kinetic equations of homogeneous chemical reactions, e.g. versions of Lotka- Volterra equations. Relevant questions regarded the equi- librium behavior of the models. As a consequence, the possible outcomes of population interactions were coexistence or competitive exclusion on a short time scale, and niche differentiation on a longer, evolution- ary time scale (Mac Arthur &amp; Levins 1967, Levins 1968, Cody 1974, Schoener 1974, Wilson &amp; Roxburgh 1992). These models disregarded the spatial aspects of community dynamics, i.e. assumed that any single locality was representative for the global-scale dynamics. Thus, the resulting rules of coexistence or competitive exclusion did not depend on the spatial scale. This simplification allowed the use of species richness as a single descriptor of the state of a com- munity (Pianka 1966, Wilson et al. 1987, Palmer 1994). Community organization was attempted to be explained by global-scale population interactions. The role of spatial variation and spatial interdependence of populations was disregarded. The most important message of classical community theory was that the number of species coexisting at equilibrium cannot exceed the number of limiting resources. This created the famous paradox of diver- sity (Hutchinson 1959). Theoretical solutions for the diversity paradox inspired a new generation of models (see Czárán &amp; Bartha 1992 for review), that introduced more realistic assumptions about the spatio-temporal structure of the environment, of the populations, and of the interactions among populations. There were several, relatively well-documented notions that promoted the development of new theories: sedentary nature of pląnts, spatially limited dispersal of propagules, local nature of interactions, the particular size- and demographic structures of populations, the occurrence of various architectural types, and the exis- tence of environmental inhomogeneity in space and time. The incorporation of these new elements into the theoretical models yielded a diversity of new coexis- tence criteria (see De Angelis et al. 1979, Shmida &amp; Ellner 1984, Pacala 1986, Czárán 1989, Herben 1992, Hara 1993, Tilman 1994). In general, spatial effects were found to be facilitating the coexistence of more species than predicted by classical models (Czárán &amp; Bartha 1992, Tilman &amp; Pacala 1993, Pacala &amp; Tilman 1994). Further studies revealed that global, community scale steady-states are often achieved through local non-equilibria (Chesson and Huntly 1989, Herben et al. 1993b). An important factor here, which facilitates coexistence, is the relative spatial isolation of local dynamics. Coupling spatially explicit modeling with the spatial analysis of the generated patterns revealed a spatio-temporal dependence among localities, result- ing in the existence of autocorrelated regions (e.g. Czárán &amp; Bartha 1989, Cain et al. 1995). Field studies that recorded fine-scale changes of vegetation in per- manent grids validated these theoretical findings (Gloaguen &amp; Gautier 1981, Juhász-Nagy &amp; Podani 1983, Hogeweg et al. 1985, Bartha 1992, Herben et al. 1995). Regional (i.e. mid-scale) structures play an important role in community organization. There is an inter- dependence, a feedback relation between pattern and process in a community (cf. Herben 1992). Mid-scale structures play a central role in mediating this feed- back. For example, they determine "encounter probabilities" of the component populations. By this, they influence the chance of the occurrence of par- ticular interactions and, eventually, the speed of pat- tern transformations (Czárán &amp; Bartha 1989, Herben 1992, Silvertown et al. 1992). Clonal populations have their own regulatory mechanisms exactly on this inter- mediate scale. Therefore, they have a great potential to influence community organization. Effects of clonal characteristics on community organization In this section, we discuss effects that have been direct- ly shown or indirectly suggested in the literature in the context of community organization. It is important to emphasize that this area, in general, is largely unex- plored. Therefore, we do not attempt to provide a com- plete theoretical framework for the study of clonality. Our aim is to arrange the presently available informa- tion, and to call attention to the richness of possible</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 19(1 995) 1 1 9 mechanisms by which clonality influences community organization. The effects of clonal traits will be discussed below ac- cording to the rows of Table 1. The general clonal characteristics that we consider ([l]-[5]) were gathered by viewing clonality from various aspects, from clonal ontogeny to clonal reproduction. The specific charac- teristics ([1.1]-[5.1]) are particular consequences of these, usually, in a more limited set of clonal species. [1] Open developmental program During their ontogeny, clonal plants re-iterate the developmental program of their building modules (ramets) a number of times (Harper &amp; Bell 1979, Jack- son et al. 1985). This number is practically unlimited: once a genet has become established, production of its ramets can continue over decades or centuries (see above). Little selection occurs in established clonal patches (Pitelka et al. 1985). Genet mortality can even decrease with age (Sackville Hamilton et al. 1987). As a consequence, a clone can achieve enormous reproductive output, very long lifespan and large size (Harper 1985, Cook 1985). [1.1] Extremely long lifespan of genets. Stable presence of the clones causes an inertia in the composi- tion of the community. Locally, a genet can monopol- ize space over a long time (Herben 1992). Especially the phalanx growth strategists are apt to achieve local monodominance (Lovett Doust 1981, Schmid &amp; Har- per 1985). On the community scale, long-living clones may "freeze" a spatial pattern. They can slow down a successional process, or create alternative succes- sional pathways (Prach 1987, Myster &amp; Pickett 1990, 1994, Bartha 1992). Pure stands formed by rhizomatous perennials are infamously persistent (Hutchings 1979), and their invasion may inhibit the recovery of vegetation after disturbance. The inertia caused by long persistence serves as a "buffer" against temporal heterogeneity of the environment. Both climatic fluctuations and directional changes (like global warming) have been considered in this respect (Callaghan et al. 1992a). Another important point is that if persistence is long enough, local selection of co- habitant species can be effective, creating detectable spatial associations in the community (Turkington &amp; Cavers 1979, Svensson &amp; Callaghan 1988, Bartha et al. 1995a). Moreover, genets may persist over a time period that is consistent with the time course of microevolutionary changes by other species, allowing local co-adaptation (Turkington &amp; Harper 1979c, Aarssen et al. 1979). [1.2] Extremely large size of genets. Clonal plants are specialized in horizontal growth (Harper 1985, cf. Huber in this volume), thus escaping the biomechani- cal size constraints that are present in other large plants, like trees (Harper 1985, Watkinson 1988). A single genet can extend over thousands of square meters (Cook 1985). A local-scale consequence of this is a considerable bud-bank in the clonal patch (Harper 1977, Cowie et al. in this volume, Hroudo vá &amp; Zak- ravsky in this volume, Newton &amp; Hay in this volume). This readily available bud-bank allows quick microsite recolonization, whenever a gap appears, thus restoring the vegetation cover (Turkington et al. 1979, Kenkel in this volume). On the community scale, an important effect of large size is that the spatial grain of the clonal patches can well exceed the spatial grain of habitat patchiness. A large genet is likely to encounter a variety of environmental conditions both above- and below-ground (Herben et al. 1994). Thus, the same genetic individual is hazarded to a diversity of selec- tive forces (Harper 1985), spreading the risk of mor- tality among several ramets (Eriksson and Jerling 1990). As a result of selection, specialization for "sub- niches" by each clone is possible (Sebens &amp; Thorne 1985, Jonsson in this volume). Effective risk spreading ensures the permanence of the species in the com- munity. The same way as long lifespan buffers against temporal heterogeneity, large size buffers against spa- tial heterogeneity. [2] Organized spatial structure A noticeable consequence of the organization on the genet level is that ramets of a clone are not indepen- dently placed in space. When spreading by seeds, the offspring is often clumped around the seed source, but particular positions around the parent are not distin- guished. When spreading vegetatively, positions of newly formed ramets depend on the actual structure of the rest of the clone, at least to the extent that the apical meristems that are the starting points for developing new ramets have already got a specific spatial pattern (see Waller &amp; Steingraeber 1985). This kind of spatial dependence between ramet generations is a strong determinant of the spatial structure of a population. Besides this simple positional constraint, the pre-exist- ing ramets may actively influence the positions of next ramets (see van Groenendael &amp; de Kroon 1990a about the regulation of clonal growth). The rules for stolon and rhizome elongation and branching have been ex- tensively studied by dynamic morphological models (Bell. &amp; Tomlinson 1980, Bell 1984). Some clonal plants exhibit a strictly organized spatial structure with regular placement of ramets (Bell &amp; Tomlinson 1980). In other species, stochasticity in the growth rules be- comes noticeable (Cain et al. 1991). In this section, we focus on some consequences of regularity (see [2.1]). Another important point is that clonal growth rules</page><page sequence="6">1 20 Oborny &amp; Bartha: Clonality in plant communities may be conditional, depending on the actual environ- ment (e.g. Cowie in this volume, Huber in this volume). Plasticity of horizontal growth provides a clonal species with special capacity for resource cap- ture (de Kroon &amp; Hutchings 1995) (see [1.2]). A par- ticular consequence of spatial organization is that density of ramets can be regulated within the clone. Al- though the growth rules that are responsible for density regulation are mentioned in [2.1] and [2.2], we will devote a separate paragraph to density (see [2.3]), be- cause of its importance in community structure. [2.1] Regular placement of ramets. A number of clonal species follows rather strict constructional rules (Bell &amp; Tomlinson 1980, Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985). For example, the direction of growth of a stolon or rhizome can be maintained over long distances, producing a series of ramets along a straight line (as observed in Care) c arenaria: Noble et al. 1979, or Fragaria chiloensis : Alpert in press). Branching of stolons or rhizomes can also follow a strict program (Bell 1984, Harper 1985). Each set of constructional rules determines how tightly the ramets will be packed in the horizontal plane (e.g. Smith &amp; Palmer 1976). On a local scale, this largely influences the chance of in- traspecific versus interspecific contacts (Turkington &amp; Harper 1979b). In phalanx strategist clones, the ramets are tightly packed, increasing the frequency of in- traclonal contacts. Guerrilla strategists tend to disperse their ramets, increasing the chance of encountering neighbors that belong to another species (Lovett Doust 1981, Schmid &amp; Harper 1985). Coexistence criteria of phalanx and guerrilla species were studied in spatially explicit models by Winkler and Schmid (in this volume) and Herben (in this volume). Winkler and Schmid compare the short-term and long-term deter- minants of competitive success. Herben examines the criteria for coexistence under founder vs. dominance control of the interactions. Both models suggest that "spatial combining ability" of growth forms is a strong constraint in community organization. Regularities in spatial spreading lead to the formation of characteristic structures of space occupation (like round clumps or fairy rings, cf. Bell 1984, Cain et al. 1991), and conse- quently, characteristic gap structures that are left for occupation by other species (see Jakucs 1972, Grubb 1977). Changes in gap structure caused by gradual genet disintegration in Filipendula ulmaria was found to affect species turnover, influencing the course of succession in the field (Falinska 1995). If a dominant clonal species tends to form patches, environmental heterogeneity is created, which has been generally ac- cepted to facilitate species coexistence (Tilman 1994). A specific case of this is when the dominant species (e.g. a grass) forms a stable matrix interrupted by dis- persed gaps, in which other species can inhabit, avoid- ing each other's competitive exclusion. In artificial grass-legume communities, Turkington and Cavers (1979) demonstrated that the grass matrix prevents clumping of the legume species and facilitates the development of associations between legumes. Founder vs. dominance control of interaction between the clonal matrix and the subordinate species has been suggested to determine the persistence of subordinates (Herben in this volume). [2.2] Plastic placement of ramets. Several species have been reported to alter their clonal growth charac- teristics (like the intensity of branching or the length of internodes) in their rhizome or stolon systems in response to environmental clues (e.g. to the spectral composition of light or to the concentration of nutrients) (Sutherland &amp; Stillman 1988, Hutchings &amp; de Kroon 1994, Huber in this volume). Plastic growth rules, like the rigid growth rules dealt with above, also influence the chance of interspecific vs. intraspecific contacts (Lovett Doust 1981, Schmid &amp; Harper 1985). If essential resources are heterogeneously distributed in the environment, plastic growth responses can sig- nificantly increase the chance of resource acquisition. This phenomenon has been termed plant foraging (see Hutchings &amp; Slade 1988, Sutherland &amp; Stillman 1988, Oborny 1994, de Kroon &amp; Hutchings 1995, Newton &amp; Hay in this volume). The speed and accuracy of forag- ing growth has been suggested to be related to the dominant vs. opportunist nature of the species in the community (Campbell et al. 1991). The capacity of clones to discover and occupy newly appearing patches of resource surplus may lead to well- balanced resource use in the community. Mobility of clonal plants is considerable. Runners of guerrilla strategists can advance half a meter per year (Eriksson &amp; Jerling 1990). Clonal plants, in a sense, are "freed from being fixed at the site where the seed germinated" (Herben et al. 1994). Thus, clones are lar- gely responsible for dynamic re-arrangements of spa- tial pattern in the community (e.g. Turkington &amp; Harper 1979a, Thórhallsdóttir 1990, Herben &amp; Hara, in press). Simultaneous mobility of several species has been found to be an important factor in species coexis- tence in grasslands (Herben et al. 1993a, Hara 1994) and in cryptogamic communities (Herben 1992). Prach and Pysek (1994) conclude that the main ad- vantage of clonality in early successional stages is a rapid cover of large areas, while in the late succes- sional stages, a rapid filling of gaps. [2.3] Density regulation. Absence of self-thinning in some ramet populations was the first observation which suggested that density is actively regulated</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 19(1 995) 1 2 1 within a clone (Hutchings &amp; Barkham 1976, Pitelka et al. 1985). "Birth control" of ramets (Schmid 1990) and integration of ramet growth leads to a tendency for even shoot dispersion pattern that minimizes in- traclonal competition (Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985, Wat- kinson 1988, Carlsson &amp; Callaghan 1990, de Kroon &amp; Kwant 1991, Kenkel in this volume). Beneficial den- sity-dependent effects, like physical protection against frost (Callaghan 1988) or desiccation (de Kroon &amp; van Groenendael 1990, During 1990) also select in favor of aggregation. Density regulation is different in phalanx and guerrilla species (Schmid &amp; Harper 1985). Ramet density in a phalanx species can be ex- tremely high (Cook 1985), preventing seedling es- tablishment by the same or by other species (Silander 1985), as well as establishment by vegetative propagules (Silvertown et al. 1992). In a community, the occurrence of monodominant patches of clonal species strongly determines the spatial structure, and, if the patches cover a large area, may increase the resistance of the whole community to invasion (Bartha 1992). In dense monocultures, habitat conditions are largely determined by endogenous factors (Kenkel in this volume). In studies of competitive hierarchies in stands of clonal plants, it was found that clonal or- ganization promotes symmetric competition between genets (de Kroon et al. 1992, Hara 1994). A resulting non-transitivity of competitive relations promotes species coexistence and, in the long run, increases diversity (as have been observed in grasslands: Hara 1994). [3] Functional interdependence of ramets The structural interdependence, discussed above, is only one aspect of clonal organization. Another, similarly important aspect is functional interdepen- dence. Ramets can exchange nutrients, water, photoas- similates and hormones. In some species, integration of the clone is maintained throughout the life of the clone. In others, only juvenile ramets are subsidized, and the established ramets become practically in- dependent. This independence can be reversible or ir- reversible (for review see Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985, Marshall 1990). An extreme case of the latter is when the physical contact is broken between the ramets, and the clone becomes fragmented (Eriksson &amp; Jerling 1990, Wilhalm in this volume). But in each clonal species, at least in its initial stage of life, a ramet receives resources from the rest of the clone (see [3.1]), and its development is influenced by the infor- mation received from other ramets (see [3.2]). [3.1] Physiological integration of the genet. In several species, strong, established ramets subsidize juvenile ramets, or those which are stressed or competitively suppressed (Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985, Marshall 1990, Alpert in this volume). A strong advantage of a clonal plant over a non-clonal plant is that it can re-organize the partitioning of resources in response to local needs (Callaghan et al. 1986, Kemball et al. 1992). It has been suggested that cooperation between ramets can introduce novel strategies of response to environmen- tal patchiness (Stuefer in this volume, see also division of labor: Stuefer et al. in press). Integration promotes regeneration after local damage before other plants could invade the gap (Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985), and in the community, serves as a buffer against small-scale disturbances. In particular, tolerance to herbivory can be increased by a subsidy to damaged ramets (Schmid et al. 1988, Callaghan et al. 1992b). Internal re-dis- tribution of resources, and a subsequent increase in the evenness of biomass (Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985) tends to diminish the contrast of resource patchiness under the clone (cf. Campbell et al. 1991, Hutchings &amp; de Kroon 1994). Interactions with neighboring plants can also be "evened out" by sharing the resources within the clone (Hartnett &amp; Bazzaz 1985). [3.2] Phenological integration of the genet. When a clone produces a sequence of ramets along a stolon or a rhizome, a series of developmental decisions is made about the fate of each meristem (Watson 1990). State of the entire clone and the particular position of a ramet within the clone can largely influence the advance of developmental steps in each ramet (Waller and Steingraeber 1985, Carlsson &amp; Callaghan 1990, Cowie et al. in this volume). Birth, differentiation and sometimes even senescence of ramets are programmed (Schmid 1990). Synchronization of developmental events in a group of interconnected ramets can narrow the phenological niche in the species, which may facilitate species coexistence due to increasing tem- poral niche differentiation (cf. Wilson 1990, Armbruster 1995). [4] Occurrence of specific organs In several clonal species, horizontal spread is con- comitant with the differentiation of specific organs, like stolons, rhizomes, tubers, bulbs and bulbils (Silander 1985). These means of vegetative reproduc- tion have long been utilized in the agricultural and hor- ticultural practice, and studied in natural habitats (Harper, 1985). Now we consider one particular aspect: their capacity for storage. [4.1] Efficient means for storage. Reservoirs can be rapidly re-mobilized when the ramets start their annual development in the favorable season, or when they recover after damage (Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985). Thus, not only a subsidy from fellow-ramets (see [3.1]), but</page><page sequence="8">1 22 Oborny &amp; Bartha: Clonality in plant communities also a subsidy from the reservoir can promote rapid compensation for local damage, and on die community level, tolerance to small-scale disturbance (Eriksson &amp; Jerling 1990, Pitelka &amp; Ashmun 1985, de Kroon &amp; van Groenendael 1990). Other examples illustrate that storage contributes to a tolerance to relatively long- lasting severe conditions (Hroudová &amp; Zakravsky in this volume, Cowie et al. in this volume). [5] Occurrence of two kinds of offspring Seeds and vegetative propagules are alternative means for dispersal. As a general trend, vegetative reproduc- tion is specialized for efficient local dispersal and per- sistence, while seeds enable the species to spread at larger distances (Silander 1985). By vegetative reproduction, "a successful genotype can be successful repeatedly in both space and time" (Sebens &amp; Thorne 1985). The progeny is produced by somatic embryogenesis, being thus subsidized by its parent (Tuomi &amp; Vuorisalo 1989). [5.1] Different needs for establishment by the two kinds of offspring. In general, the reproductive cost is lower, and the tolerance to stress and competition is broader by vegetative progeny than by seeds (Silander 1985, Sebens &amp; Thorne 1985). Seedling establishment in many clonal species is a rare event, and is limited to specific safe sites (see Harper 1977), thus, the popula- tion is primarily maintained by clonal reproduction (Eriksson 1993, Jonsson in this volume, Kull in this volume). Due to their broader tolerance, the clonal of- fspring can pioneer in empty areas (Thórhallsdóttir 1990, Jeník 1994). They can occupy unfavorable patches that are not available to sexual reproduction (Alpert in this volume, Jonsson in this volume). A community-scale outcome of the simultaneous exis- tence of two kinds of reproduction is the hierarchical nature of population dynamics (see White 1979, Kull in this volume), and a consequent hierarchical nature of revolutionary processes (cf. Tuomi &amp; Vuorisalo 1989). Epilogue Non-spatial community theory tended to over-em- phasize the importance of competitive interactions in structuring plant assemblages. The very existence of spatial constraints in plant communities suggests that traits other than competitive ability contribute to com- munity organization (Pickett et al. 1987, Tilman 1988, Pickett &amp; McDonnell 1989, Kolasa &amp; Pickett 1991). This notion is supported by the results of theoretical studies using spatio-temporal models for species coexistence (Tilman &amp; Pacala 1993, Bartha et al. 1995b). What kinds of other traits can be important here? Of primary importance is the response of the species to spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the en- vironment (cf. Cain &amp; Oborny ms, Stuefer in press). The majority of vegetation analyses, being based on snap-shot data, consider a community as a "frozen sys- tem", in which the individuals are anchored in space. But when mobility of the populations is taken into ac- count, an impressive diversity of spatial strategies can be observed (cf. Watt 1947, Glenn &amp; Collins 1990, van der Maarel &amp; Sykes 1993, Herben et al. 1993a, Oborny 1994, Winkler &amp; Schmid in this volume). Spatial be- havior largely influences the success of a population in exploring resources, coping with competitors and tolerating disturbance (see Hutchings &amp; de Kroon 1994, Herben in this volume, Winkler &amp; Schmid in this volume, Cain &amp; Oborny ms). In general, a trade-off has been observed between the traits influencing mobility and the traits influencing local performance of a population (Tilman 1988, 1990). One extreme strategy is to maximize mobility, having high growth rate, large reproductive output, and efficient dispersal, coupled with short lifespan and weak competitive ability. The alternative strategy is to monopolize space locally, by increasing the lifespan and the efficiency and precision of local resource up- take (Tilman 1988, 1990, see also Campbell et al. 1991). A result of the trade-off between mobility and local performance has been shown in successional processes, where it was found to account for the se- quence of dominant species (Tilman 1988, 1990, 1993). We suggest to consider the hypothesis that an ad- vantage of clonal plants over aclonal plants is an es- cape from this trade-off. It has been shown that the cost of vegetative reproduction is generally lower than the cost of reproduction by seeds, and the establishment of the progeny is more successful in a wider range of habitat types (see [5]). Clones have a potential to be mobile and to forage for resource patches (see [2]), and at the same time, to keep the space once occupied, by subsidizing established ramets in the case of stress, disturbance, or competitive pressure (see [3]) and by preserving storage organs with a considerable bud bank under the clone (see [1] and [4]). There are varia- tions in the emphasis on mobility vs. local success (as expressed by distinguishing between guerrilla and phalanx growth forms). But we argue that the trade-off is less pronounced, and consequently, clonal plants have a larger scope to combine strategies of capturing and maintaining space. As an effect of sophisticated spatial strategies and dynamic allocation patterns (see [2] and [3]), co- dominant clonal species (e.g. grasses in grasslands)</page><page sequence="9">Abstracta Botanica 19(1 995) 1 23 can develop well-balanced competitive relations. In these communities, hierarchy is not severe, even non- transitivity of competitive relations occurs (de Kroon et al. 1992, Hara 1994, Herben in this volume). Subor- dinate species encounter a characteristic gap pattern, formed by the matrix of dominant clones (see [2.1]). Spatial isolation of competitive subordinates in the matrix contributes to maintaining species richness (Glenn &amp; Collins 1990, Czárán &amp; Bartha 1992). This scenario results in stochastic, dynamically changing species assemblages on a local scale, and steady-state coexistence of the species on a community scale (see Glenn &amp; Collins 1990, Bartha 1992, van der Maarel &amp; Sykes 1993, Herben et al. 1993a). Mid-scale organiza- tion of clonal species is an important mediator between the small-scale and the large-scale dynamics. In summary, this paper shows that clonal development offers various mechanisms by which plants can escape the constraints of finite size and finite longevity and can release the trade-off between mobility and local persistence. This opens the scope of possible mechanisms in community organization. On the other hand, clonality introduces its own constraints into the community, due to a genet-level control of architec- ture, resource use and phenology. Consideration of specific features of clonality in a community context should help to better understand both clonality and community organization. Acknowledgements.
