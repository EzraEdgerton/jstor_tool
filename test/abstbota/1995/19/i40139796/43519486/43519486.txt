Abstract: Genet and ramet dynamics of Cypripedium calceolus L. ( Orchidaceae ) were studied in five populations which inhabit different plant communities in Estonia. Clones (genets), identified with the aid of isozyme electrophoresis, were observed within permanent plots for at least ten years. Matrix analysis was used to study genet dynamics, in which the genets were separated into different size classes (according to the number of aerial ramets). Genet dynamics were much more stable than ramet dynamics. The fluctuations in population size were mainly a result of changes in genet sizes. There were differences in the equilibrium structure of the populations, which were related to differences in Jight conditions. The relationship between vegetative and generative reproduction was analysed quantitatively, showing the dominance of vegetative reproduction. Introduction Most demographic studies of clonal plants concentrate on the registration of birth and death rates of ramets. For a more thorough analysis of the population dyn- amics of clonal plants, the genet level should be focus- ed (Eriksson 1993). Harper (1977) introduced a precise terminology for distinguishing the genet and ramet structure of plant populations. The maintenance of a population size within an area could be the result of different processes (Fig. 1). Population changes include changes in the numbers of genets (generative reproduction and death of clones), and changes in the sizes of genets (vegetative re- production and death of ramets). To consider the im- portance of genetic processes in a population, the relationship between the vegetative and generative processes should be measured. All the processes shown in Fig. 1 can not be simul- taneously studied in natural populations. The pattern of aerial shoots in rhizomatous species does not usual- ly allow the identification of the mother ramet (of the previous year) to which a daughter ramet belongs (even if mapped very carefully). It is usually not pos- sible to count the number of subterranean shoots and buds without the use of destructive methods. Also, the origin of seeds and even seed-bank size are difficult to estimate (Eriksson 1989), particularly in Orchidaceae. Therefore, the relative impact of vegetative and gene- rative reproduction should be estimated on the basis of data about the number of aerial ramets and clones. The identification of clones is possible, using the isozyme method (Ellstrand &amp; Roose 1987, Widen et al. 1994). Our current knowledge about the relative importance of generative and vegetative reproduction on the main- tenance of populations of perennial herbs in different natural communities is very limited. The book by Sil- vertown &amp; Lovett Doust (1993) does not contain quan- titative data about the relationship of these types of reproduction in different species. Considering that n ramets are formed (in a species with annual ramets) in the year t+ 1 in a closed population (i.e. excluding im- migration and emigration) as a result of vegetative and generative reproduction, n(t+ 1) = rv n(t) + rg n(t ) , (1) where rv and rg are the vegetative and generative reproduction rates (ramets sive genets per ramet per year), then the relation rv / rg could be an estimate of the relationship between the modes of reproduction.

Letters refer to aerial shoots (A), buds or belowground shoots (B) and seeds (S). The solid lines represent ramet transitions, the broken lines - genet transi- tions, and the double lines correspond to seed processes which belong to both the ramet and the genet levels. Arrows with figures represent vegetative reproduction in terms of bud or below ground shoot formation (parts of rhizome) (1) and aerial shoot formation (2), perennial shoot growth (3), dormancy of buds (or belowground shoots) (4), death of an aerial shoot (5), death of a bud (6), generative reproduction in terms of seed formation (7) and seedling establishment (8), perennial growth of the clone (including dormancy of the clone in the case if all the ramets are dormant) (9), seed dormancy (10), death of the clone (if all its ramets die) (11), and seed death (12). The scheme corresponds to the time scale of 1-year steps. is important to emphasize that on both sides of the equation the same elements should be considered, e.g., buds and seeds (as rudimentary ramets of vegetative and generative origin), or aerial shoots. In both cases, according to Fig. 1, the reproduction consists of two processes - generative reproduction via the formation of seeds (7) and establishment of seedlings (8), or vegetative reproduction via the formation of buds (1) and shoot growth (2). It is not easy to distinguish bet- ween the different stages of dormancy of buds or seeds, and therefore it is much better to use the number of aerial shoots as the variable in equation (1). In species with perennial ramets, the ramet age should also be considered, and the first-year shoots and see- dlings could be the elements easiest to count. Therefore, one of the reasons why the relative impor- tance of vegetative versus generative reproduction is rarely analysed, is the lack of precise and generally ac- cepted methods. The method which uses transition matrices is well developed theoretically (Caswell 1985), but it is usually hard (or impossible) to ac- curately calculate transition probabilities related to generative reproduction from population demography data, which is why estimates are often used (Charron &amp; Gagnon 1991). In this study, I use matrix analysis of the genet dynamics of five populations of Cypripedium cal- ceolus , where the genets are classified according to their size (number of aerial ramets). My aim is to es- timate' the relative importance of ramet and genet dynamics for population maintenance on the basis of permanent plot data. Material and methods Species characteristics Cypripedium calceolus L. ( Orchidaceae ) is a her- baceous perennial whose clones can live for over 100 years (Kull 1988). The rhizome is characterized by a zigzag growth pattern with annual increments of 0.5- 1.1 cm (Kull 1987, Kull &amp; Kull 1991). Ramets are an- nual and produce 0-2 daughter ramets which rise above ground in the following year. Of the two buds which are able to form daugther ramets one or in rare cases both may stay dormant for at least one year. Thus, if all buds of a clone stay dormant, the whole clone does not have any aerial shoots, i.e. the clone is dormant. However, it is difficult to distinguish bet- ween dead and dormant rhizomes. Despite the fact that the dormant buds stay anatomically alive for at least 10 years on a living rhizome, the growth of a bud after several years of dormancy is exceptionally rare. The pre-reproductive period (from seed germination to flowering plant) in natural conditions probably lasts for nearly ten years. The first green leaf is commonly produced four years after germination (Ziegenspeck 1936). Study sites and data collection The five populations studied were located in different plant communities in western and central Estonia, classified according to the habitat types recognized by Kalda (1987) (Table 1). The pine forest and wooded meadow sites are near to each other (distance is 800 m), all the other populations are separated by 15 to 280 km. The light conditions at the sites were measured with the fish-eye photographs method, enabling the calcula- tion of the light penetration coefficient (or diffuse site factor) (Anderson 1964, Madgwick &amp; Brumfield 1969). The coefficient (having values from 1 to 0) shows the quantity of light reaching the herb layer rela- tive to the fully open site. The history of light condi- tions at the different sites has been different during the last decades. At the Muhul site, the wooded meadow has not been managed and as a result of overgrowth the</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 19(1 995) 97 Table 1.

At Ussisoo (spruce forest) and Tooma (drained forest), logging in the vicinity has changed the light conditions, while the Muhu II (pine forest) and Oisu (swamp forest) sites have had stable light conditions. In each population, all clones (including those which arose as a result of sexual recruitment during the study period) on a fixed permanent plot were mapped and the number of ramets of each clone was counted every year (Table 1). In this study, we could use populations with clearly distinguished clones. Isozyme analysis Isozyme analysis from leaves was used to distinguish clones on the permanent plots (Kull 1988). Enzyme extracts were prepared by crushing small leaf pieces in a cold buffer containing 0.05 M tris-hydroxy-methyl- aminomethane (tris), 0.01 M EDTA and 5 mM cys- teine hydrochloride. After the removal of cell debris, 20-50 mg aliquots of a sucrose - Sephadex G-200 4: 1 mixture were added to the enzyme extracts to increase their viscosity. The extracts were immediately sub- jected to electrophoresis in a Polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated and stained in histochemical mixtures (Jaaska 1981, Jaaska &amp; Jaaska 1986). The following isozymes, showing polymor- phism, were of practical use in distinguishing clones: superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), aspartate aminotransferase (AAT, EC 2.6.1.1), esterase (EST, EC 3.1.1.1). Data analysis The number of ramets of a clone was chosen as the size variable for projection matrix analysis of the popula- tion dynamics. The size classes used were 0 = no ramets, 1 = 1-2 ramets, 2 = 3-5 ramets, 3 = 6- 10 ramets, 4=11-15 ramets, 5 = over 16 ramets in the clone. The size rather than age has often been used in this type of investigations (Charron &amp; Gagnon 1991). The stan- dard projection matrix model was used; this sum- marizes the transition probabilities from one size class to another in time steps equal to one year (van Groenendael et al. 1988, Silvertown &amp; Lovett Doust 1993, Charron &amp; Gagnon 1991). The model used has the following form in matrix notation: n(i+l) = A * n(ř) , (2) where n(i) is a column vector describing the clonal size structure of the population at time i, and A is a square matrix of the associated transition frequencies. The transition matrices were built for three different models (Fig. 2). Model 1 assumes that new ramets may arise only vegetatively, and all clones which disappear are con- sidered to be dormant. Accordingly, dormancy may last for a long time. It follows that the number of clones (dormant plus growing) is constant. The sum of ele- ments in each column of the transition matrix is equal to 1. Model 2 assumes that new ramets may arise only vegetatively, but that dormancy may last one season at most. In contrast to model one, the transition 0-0 has value zero, and the other elements of the first column have normalized values to give a sum equal to 1. All the other elements in the matrix are equal to those of model one.</page><page sequence="4">98 Kuli: Genet and ramet dynamics 1 2 3 o o° o R R R u u u D D O Figure 2. Processes included in three population models: (1) dormant state may stay alive for many years; (2) dor- mant state cannot last over 1 year; (3) dormant state is not considered, clones may disappear and appear anew. R represents clones with aerial ramets and D dormant clones. Model 3 assumes that clones may disappear and ap- pear, without distinguishing between growth from seed and growth from dormant rhizome. In contrast to models one and two, the transition matrices omit the first (0) row and the first (0) column. Therefore, column sums may become smaller than 1. The ap- pearance of new clones (the information about this was contained in the 0-column) is described by adding the frequencies of appearance to the corresponding diagonal elements of the transition matrix. There was not enough data to build a model which could consider both death and dormancy of the clones as different states. The mean matrices for each population were used, computed over all the years. The annual matrices were not used because of the low number of clones in the populations. For technical reasons, the transition frequencies equal to zero in Table 2 were replaced by the value 0.01. It enables one to get values in the transition matrix for the columns where all values were initially zero (e.g., the right columns of the transition matrices for swamp forest and wooded meadow site). The influence of this technical detail on the calculated matrix parameters and other results is negligible. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues were calculated for the mean matrices. The sensitivity (Sy ) and elasticity (&lt; e ij ) coefficients were calculated according to the formulae Sij = V/ Wj / &lt;w,v&gt; , (3) where v and w are respectively the left and right eigen- vectors of the matrix A and &lt;w,v&gt; is their scalar product, and ey = a¡j / X * s¡j , (4) where ay is an element of matrix A and X is its dominant eigenvalue (de Kroon et al. 1986, van Groe- nendael et al. 1988, Silvertown &amp; Lovett Doust 1993).

In that case, fl(í+l) = X * n(t) , (5) where n(t) is population size in the year t. From (5) we get Xk = n(t+k) / n(t) , (6) where k is the length of the period (number of years). Results The population structures according to genet size are considerably different between the studied popula- tions, the wooded meadow population being one ex- treme with the highest proportion of small clones, and the spruce forest population being the other extreme with the highest proportion of large clones (Fig. 3). The observed transition frequencies of the studied populations are given in Table 2. The values of the non-zero 0-0 elements correspond to the observation of 2 or 3 years dormancy. Cases of 1 year dormancy of the clones have been recorded in all studied popula- tions, 2 year dormancy once in the spruce forest population and 3 year dormancy once in the wooded meadow population. On the basis of the observed transition frequencies, the corresponding transition matrices with transition probability values were built according to the assump- tions of the three models used. The transition matrices for model 3 are given in Table 3. The eigenvalues of the transition matrices, as com- pared to the À, values calculated directly using equation (6), are represented in Table 4. According to the as- sumptions used in the case of models (1) and (2), k=l. The X values calculated from the matrix model are very close to the values obtained from the exponential growth equation (6), except for the swamp forest population. The equilibrium structures (right eigenvectors of the transition matrices) of the populations as calculated by the three different models, are given in Table 5. Regardless of the exclusion of mortality in models (1) and (2), all three models result in relatively similar equilibrium structures (stable states) in size-classes 1- 5. The values for size class 0 according to model (1) are the maximum estimates of dormant clones, the highest being 8% for the wooded meadow population. The parameters characterizing fluctuations of ramet and genet numbers throughout the years (including CV - standard deviation divided by arithmetic mean) are given in Table 6. The coefficient of variation of the number of genets is always smaller than that of the number of ramets (Table 6). The growth rates of ramet numbers also vary more than the growth rates of genet numbers (Table 4). Figure 3.

Discussion The striking feature of the studied Cypripedium cal- ceolus populations is their stability on the genet level for a period longer than a decade regardless of their relatively small clones and annual ramets. This may be remarkable to find in an endangered species, which has almost disappeared from many European countries during the last half-century. However, the long-term persistence of a single clone in England is well-known (Wells 1994). In a previous (ramet-level) study in Polish C. calceolus populations the number of aerial shoots and the proportion of generative shoots did not change significantly between 1986 and 1989 (Kor- czyński &amp; Spiewakowski 1991). An important conclusion from this study is that genet dynamics have less fluctuations and are much more stable than ramet dynamics. It means that the popula- tion reacts to changes in environmental conditions mainly through changes in the size of genets, not through the number of genets, i.e. populations change their vegetative reproduction more than their genera- tive one. This is not an obvious result, since generative reproduction has a much higher potential of relative change than vegetative reproduction, particularly in the case of C. calceolus which can have a maximum of two vegetative ramets per ramet per year, but can produce thousands of seeds. One capsule contains ap- proximately 20,000 seeds (Sadovsky 1973). According to the frequency of appearance of new clones in permanent plots, the value of rv / rg is over 100 in the studied populations. More exact estimations require longer periods of observation. In comparison, rv / rg has been measured as 0.3-0.5 in Se seli ledebouri , 7-33 in Helichrysum arenarium , and over 100 in Scorzonera ensifolia (Voronzova &amp; Zaugol- nova 1985). The relative number of ramets of vegeta- tive origin have in several studies been found to be higher in later rather than in earlier stages of succes- sion (e.g., Falinska 1985, Eriksson 1993). The seed production, measured as the number of cap- sules, is clearly more variable than the number of ramets and genets (cf. Tables 7 and 6). Nevertheless, I did not observe seed production to have any influence on the formation of new genets. The permanently higher mean values of fruit production (as in the pine forest population) are not reflected in the population growth rates (Table 4). Consequently, seed production itself has almost nothing to do with population dyn- amics in this species within a period of time longer than a decade. The number of seeds is evidently not the limiting factor for population growth. The relative importance of vegetative and generative reproduction on population maintenance in three Ranunculus species has been studied by Sarukhan &amp; Gadgil (1974). In place of this kind of analysis, de Kroon et al. (1986) proposed the use of elasticity coef- ficients as better characteristics. According to the rules for building transition matrices used in this study, the impact of generative reproduction should be reflected mainly by the value of e'' . Indeed, the population with the largest e'' value in the wooded meadow (Table 3) also has the highest variability (CV value) of genet number (Table 6). If the CV for ramet number is equal to the CV of genet number, all variability of the population size is caused by generative reproduction, assuming that the mean size of genets remains un- changed. Accordingly, a more adequate basis for the comparison of the impact of vegetative and generative reproduction on population maintenance could be the CV value of genet number as compared to the CV value of the ramets per genet. The results given in Table 6 (last two columns) support the conclusion of the higher relative importance of vegetative reproduc- tion. However, the assumption of constant clone size may not be correct (as in the present case) and the CV values of genet and ramet number may then be com- pared directly. A theoretical analysis of ramet and genet demography based on transition matrix models has been provided by Caswell (1985). According to him, in size-clas- sified populations the reproductive value should in- crease monotonically with size. In this study, the situation seems to be reversed, but this is an effect of not including seed production into the model. The ex- tremely high number of seeds produced in C. cal- ceolus , in relation to a very low rate /of sexual</page><page sequence="9">Abstracta Botanica 19 (1995) 103 recruitment would give a large bias in trying to es- timate the proportions of seeds giving rise to new clones. Therefore, to get a better understanding of the relative importance of generative versus vegetative reproduction in species with life-histories like C. cal- ceolus , I consider it to be important to use models which do not include seed production. Dormancy over seasons is recorded in several species within the family Orchidaceae. For example, ramets in Ophrys sphegodes can enter a dormant subterranean state which normally lasts for no longer than two con- secutive years (Hutchings 1987). Orchid investigators usually consider a plant dead when a plant is missing for the third year (Gregg 1991). However, the period from the germination of a seed to the first aerial life stages may last for four years or more ( Ziegenspeck 1936, Sadovsky 1973) which makes the studies of genet dynamics exceptionally difficult. Despite the lack of knowledge about the frequency of dormancy in C. calceolus , this is not likely to change my overall predictions of the populations dynamics. With the use of three different models, in relation to the role of dormancy, I obtained similar results in the equi- librium structure of the populations (represented by right eigenvectors of the transition matrices in Table 5). Thus, the numbers of dormant clones in populations of C. calceolus are not likely to be large. Matrix models have been used in several studies of plant populations, but in few studies of Orchidaceae, a plant family famous for species with long and com- plicated life-cycles. Analyses of population dynamics in orchids using matrix models have been done for ex- ample for I sot ria medeoloides (Mehrhoff 1989), Cleis- tes divaricata (Gregg 1991), and Ophrys sphegodes (Waite &amp; Hutchings 1991). In a previous study (Kull 1987), a matrix model of the dynamics of the propor- tion of flowering ramets of clones was utilized in a C. calceolus population from Estonia. Charron &amp; Gagnon (1991) give an overview of X values estimated for different species. They note that species associated with stable forest environments as Chamaelirium luteum , Arisaema serratum and A. triphyllum , Allium tricoccum and Panax quin - quefolium have X values close to 1. C. calceolus as mainly a forest plant at our latitude can also be added to that list. The X value itself, however, cannot be a species characteristic since it depends mainly on the choice of population - whether the population size is decreasing, increasing or is stable. Therefore, the com- parison of species according to X- values does not real- ly make sense. Firstly, annual species may evidently have larger fluctuations in X values than perennials. Secondly, differences in X values calculated separately for genet and ramet dynamics would be more informa- tive. Table 4 shows that the ^-values calculated for both ramets and genets agree well except for the swamp forest population. Since the calculation of X directly from equation (6) assumes the equilibrium structure of a population (which does not influence the calcula- tions made by the transition matrices in Model 3), we may conclude that the swamp forest population is fur- ther from equilibrium than the other populations. In- deed, during the study period of 4 years the number of ramets was doubled (Table 6), but this change was not sufficient to drive the population far from equilibrium. The observed structure in 1994 (Table 5) shows the relative closeness to equilibrium obtained by the mo- del. However, the population structure in the swamp forest population in the first year of observation ( 199 1) differs considerably from the equilibrium (Table 5). The most prominent difference between the observed structure and the equilibrium model was found in the pine forest population (Fig. 3), which is an unexpected result because the site has not had any noticeable chan- ges in the environment during the last decades. Remarkable differences in population structures may be partially caused by different light conditions. In the wooded meadow and drained forest populations the proportion of small clones is larger and these two sites are the most shady of the studied sites. Also, the wooded meadow population has the highest frequency of clone dormancy. A possible relation between light conditions and clone size is an object of future studies, but it is noteworthy that the facultative mycotrophs (as adult plants) among European • rhizomatous Or- chidaceae usually prefer shady communities, and the obligate mycotrophs ( Corallorhiza , Neottia, Epipo- gium - which all have rhizomes) predominantly grow in shady habitats. Clone dormancy probably also re- quires mycotrophy. The variation in population structure seems to be cor- related to the differences in site history. If light condi- tions have not changed, as in the swamp forest and pine forest sites, medium size genets have the highest frequencies (Fig. 3). If the locality has become more shady, the genets with few ramets dominate (wooded meadow population), while if light-levels have in- creased as a result of logging (spruce forest and drained forest populations), large clones increase in frequency (i.e. clones grow larger).
