Grasslands are important when considering the effects of elevated CO2 because they make up a large and economically-significant part of the earth's plant cover, and substantial long-term changes in the functioning of grassland ecosystems may be expected. This brief overview covers some of the aspects of current research addressing such questions as the probability and possible magnitude of carbon storage by grasslands, differential responses of constituent species to rising atmospheric CO2, changes in turnover rates and other aspects of ecosystem function. Recent methodological developments, and possible directions and needs of future research on plant responses to elevated CO2 are briefly considered. Introduction The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been • increasing in the past two centuries from about 280 ppm to a present value of 360 ppm, and is expected to reach more than twice the pre-industrial concentration in the next century (Houghton et al. 1990). The increasing use of fossil fuels and defores- tation account for the most of this increase, which will have effects on climatic components, such as tempera- ture and rainfall. There is general agreement among different climate models that the accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O and chloro- fluorocarbons) will cause an increase in mean global temperature at the surface of earth. Although debate has continued about this topic since the end of the 19th century, it is only in the recent years that it has become possible to model the process in a more realistic way (Amthor 1995). Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and air temperature are of major concern when consider- ing the possible effects of global climate change on vegetation and their magnitudes. As a consequence of increased photosynthesis at elevated CO2, dry matter production of terrestrial C3 plants is expected to in- crease. Reviews by Kimball (1983) and Cure &amp; Acock (1986) of experiments done under a wide range of conditions have shown that a doubling of atmos- pheric CO2 from 330 to 660 ppm may increase the productivity of C3 species by an average of 33%. If these observations are extrapolated to the field, this means that the CO2 enrichment since the start of the industrial revolution could be expected to have in- creased dry matter production of C3 herbaceous plants by 7.5 - 9.0%. On a global scale grasslands cover 24% of the Earth's vegetated area (Goudriaan 1995). They occur over a broad range of climatic and soil condi- tions and vary from intensively managed sown pas- tures to natural grasslands. Despite their importance, the potential effects of climate change on grasslands have received much less attention than effects on other ecosystems such as forests (Eamus &amp; Jarvis 1989, Ceulemans &amp; Mousseau 1994). A prediction of the effects of global change on grasslands may be based on studies of the effects of temperature, radiation, humidity on single species. However, scaling from these results, usually obtained on plants growing in artificial substrates and controlled environments, to natural conditions in which competi- tion or symbiosis may play a major role (Simard et al 1997), is often misleading. An attempt to predict the</page><page sequence="2">330 Nagy et al: Elevated air CO2 and grasslands consequences of global change on grassland growth must therefore take account of both the direct effects of elevated CO2 and the indirect effects mediated by climatic change, as well as their interaction, bearing in mind the complexity of the natural ecosystems in which plants are growing. Central to many studies are the questions of future productivity of agricultural crops as well as that of natural or semi-natural grassland ecosystems and the potential carbon storage capacity of grassland ecosys- tems (e.g. Sala et al. 1996). Although production has been found to increase in many cases, other experi- ments have also indicated increased hazards for plant growth because of the increased frequency of weather extremes such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures. This brief, and by no means comprehensive, overview aims to relate the contributions made in this volume to existing knowledge in the field of vegetation responses to global climatic change. Difficulties in methodology The mechanistic models based on experimental studies give predictions about vegetation responses to global climatic change. Direct testing of the these predictions is a difficult problem, as large field experiments com- bining the effects of elevated CO2 and higher tempera- tures are difficult to set up in the open, and have seldom been attempted. In fact, only a few, expensive facilities - the free air exposure systems (FACE) - are available at present for studying the effects of elevated CO2 in realistic conditions (e.g. Schulze &amp; Mooney 1993). Open top chambers (for review, see Schulze &amp; Mooney 1993) and wind tunnels (Soussana &amp; Loiseau this volume) are the more common facilities for expos- ing the plants to high CO2 concentration and above- ambient air temperature, but their effect on the plants (the chamber effect) can mask or counteract the effect of the treatment. Open top chambers, normally con- structed of a metal frame covered with a plastic film, alter the microclimate within them, in particular radia- tion and temperature. Air is supplied by a fan and enters the chamber through a plenum around the base, with the result that the plants are submitted to an un- natural ventilation, whose rate is often sufficient to produce water stress (Leadley &amp; Drake, 1993). This latter problem has partly been solved in ventilated solardomes with improved temperature control (Rafarei et al. 1995). In fact, most of the experiments so far carried out on the effects of elevated CO2 have been conducted in growth chambers, glasshouses and in open top chambers (OTC), and our understanding can only be based on the results achieved so far (Am- thor 1995). Free air CO2 enrichment (FACE), allows the study of the effects of elevated C02 by leaving all the other parameters unchanged by avoiding the presence of a shelter between the treated area and the free environ- ment. In FACE setups air is forced through the torum of a circular plenum, and is released by holes whose opening is regulated by electrovalves on the basis of wind direction, in a way, that only the valves upwind the treated area are open. CO2 concentration in the emitted air is regulated on the basis of windspeed; the whole system being computer controlled (Hendrey et al. 1993). Widespread use of FACE systems has so far been limited by the high cost of installation and by the high gas consumption. This latter problem can partly be avoided by the use of smaller mini FACE system. In these, C02-enriched air is emitted along the whole circumference of the plenum, and the gas concentra- tion is regulated on the basis of windspeed, irrespec- tive of wind direction (Miglietta et al. 1996). It can be argued that each of the methods in use has characteristics peculiar to itself, and that none of them can be considered perfect for research purposes. Con- sequently a combination of methods (e.g., use of cuvettes or closed chambers for photosynthesis meas- urements on free air enriched crops) is often applied. However, in general, it is preferable to grow the plants in free air enrichment, as the chamber effect may be larger than the effect of the CO2 treatment. Neverthe- less, findings obtained using the different facilities are giving convergent answers to questions like the dif- ferential sensitivity of species depending on their geographical location, species-specific responses, probability of altering community structures, carbon storage by grasslands and many others. This volume has been put together in an attempt to cover some of these questions. Growth, botanical composition and C-storage Primary production of grasslands has been found to in- crease in many studies under elevated CO2 concentra- tions (Ross et al. 1995, Casella et al. 1996) and much of this increase has occurred below ground (Ross et al. 1995, Newton et al. 1995). The harvestable biomass of the grass swards grown under elevated CO2 was found to be larger than that of the control swards in several cases (e.g., Newton et al. 1995, Chen et al. 1996, Hunt et al. 1996, Jongen &amp; Jones this volume), but other studies have showed the harvestable biomass to decrease (Soussana et al. 1996b). The reason behind some of these observations is the increased allocation to the roots under the high CO2 treatment.</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 33 1 In alpine environments the hypothesis of enhanced growth under elevated CO2 is doubted although it is agreed that species-specific responses (Hunt et al., Stirling et al., Jongen &amp; Jones this volume ) may lead to altered community structure and, as a consequence, changes of ecosystem functioning in the long-term (Körner et al. 1996, Leadley &amp; Körner 1996, Leadley &amp; Stöcklin 1996, Schappi &amp; Körner 1996). At the same time increases in production of North European managed grasslands and agricultural systems are ex- pected (Hanukkala, this volume), although possible changes in the frequency of weather extremes may result in unpleasant surprises, in particular in relation to hardening and dehardening periods (Junttila 1996). On the other hand, arctic tundra vegetation showed lit- tle positive response to elevated CO2 and associated temperature increase, probably in consequence of lack of nutrients (Tissue &amp; Oechel 1987) and respiration in- crease (Hilbert et al. 1987). Considering these respon- ses, it seems that production of grasslands (and agricultural systems) is expected to increase in situa- tions where growth limitation by CO2 is significant when compared to the other main factors such as nutrient availability or temperature. When one of the latter is seriously limiting plant growth, increased at- mospheric CO2 concentration is not expected to al- leviate this limitation. At the same time, differences between species' responses can be large, which can cause alterations in species abundance and community structure. This, however, would not result in sig- nificant changes when considering the production of the whole community, although considerable changes in ecosystem functioning may occur (Schappi et al. 1996), with enhanced C- (Newton et al. 1995, Luo et al. 1996) and C- and N-turnover (Soussana et al. 1996a, Hungate et al. 1997). However, it is doubtful whether soil carbon storage capacity will increase in the long term (Hungate et al. 1996, 1997). As already mentioned, community structure is ex- pected to change due to elevated CO2 (Newton et al. 1995, Hunt et al. this volume). In the study by Newton et al. (1995) the cover of the grasses declined irrespec- tive of photosynthesis type, while that of a leguminous species ( Trifolium ssp.) increased. This suggests that photosynthesis type is not the crucial factor in future changes of grassland communities, but the role of the apparent N-limitation on growth may become decisive. It is to be noted, however, that N-content of the litter from a C4 species is less influenced by elevated CO2 than that of a C3 species with conse- quences on the N-mineralization rates in the soil (Ball et al. 1997). In FACE plots, the response of Trifolium repens to elevated CO2 was larger that that of L. perenne (Hebeisen et al. 1997). This resulted in a higher proportion of T. repens in the mixed swards at elevated CO2, although the competition for light among the different species and the management prac- tices may largely counteract the effects of elevated CO2. Under elevated CO2, species of Leguminosae have been shown to alleviate the N-limitation on the growth of the grass species (Soussana et al. 1996a). In- creased biomass allocation to the roots has also been shown to be caused by the N-limitation in other (tree) species with no C02 treatment (Zitzer et al. 1996). Under high CO2 the cause of N-limitation on growth is suggested to be the decreased N-mineralization rate (Chen et al. 1996) which, in turn, is imposed by the increased soil C:N ratio (Soussana et al. 1996a, Sous- sana et al. this volume, Ball et al. 1997). Observation of increased growth with decreased element content of the dry matter (Raschi et al. this volume) also supports the idea of increased cycling of elements in plants under elevated air CO2 concentration. So far, very little is known about the effects of elevated CO2 on below-ground processes. As the carbon dioxide concentration in soil is much higher than in the atmosphere, a direct effect may be excluded, while changes in root growth, rhizodeposition and root ex- udate composition may play a major role. While no ef- fects of elevated CO2 on bacterial number were found in soils in which C4 plants occur (Whipps 1985); in soils containing C3 plants, an increase in microbial biomass and microbial activity has often been reported, although the effects seem to vary throughout the season (Schortemeyer et al. 1997). It is possible that an increase in the bacterial biomass may im- mobilise more available soil N, thus causing a shortage of available N for plants (Diaz et al. 1993). Experi- ments aiming to assess the effect of elevated CO2 on specific microbial populations have yielded contrast- ing results (Sadowsky &amp; Schortemeier 1997), but the differences appear to be linked to the plant species, the enrichment system used and the species of bacteria under investigation; similar contrasting results were reported for soil insect populations that were shown to increase in grasslands (L. Tosi, pers. comm.), both in OTC and in FACE (although with different patterns) but were not affected in soil under a cotton crop (Runion et al. 1994). It is still unclear whether the world's grassland ecosys- tems could sequester a significant fraction of the in- creasing atmospheric CO2. The importance of this question is underlined when the apparent problem of the 'missing sink' for carbon (Goudriaan 1995) is seen alongside the relatively large proportion that the grassland vegetation contributes to the Earth's ter- restrial ecosystems (Long et al. 1992). Increasing</page><page sequence="4">332 Nagy et al: Elevated air CO2 and grasslands temperature and increased precipitation - more exact- ly, the increased frequency of soil wetting and drying - hasten the decomposition of soil organic matter (Stevenson 1982). Also, the frequency of weather ex- tremes such as drought or flooding, are expected to in- crease with climate change and this may have a serious impact on C-storage depending upon the sensitivity of the ecosystem concerned. For example, natural grasslands consisting of species highly adapted to the prevailing climatic conditions will tend to respond more moderately in terms of production or changes in C-storage than intensively managed grasslands with introduced species (Posti et al., this volume). Physiological acclimation responses Higher net photosynthetic rates have been observed in several cases as a result of elevated CO2 treatment (reviewed by Drake et al. 1997). In fact, in C3 plants that predominate in temperate climates, CO2 is cap- tured by the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate car- boxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), that also catalyzes the oxygenation of ribulose bisphosphate, a reaction that is competitively inhibited by CO2. Under elevated CO2, the competition for rubisco is reduced under light saturated conditions, while the photosynthetic quan- tum efficiency increases under light limiting condi- tions (Long 1991). At the same time, dark respiration decreases due to the inhibition of the activity of two key enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase (Gonzáles-Meler et al. 1997). In several cases, however, species specific acclimation responses by the photosynthetic apparatus have been observed in long-term exposure experiments. Both up- ward and downward regulation was found in tree species (Atkinson 1997) and in herbaceous grassland species (Tuba et al. 1996a, Nagy et al. this volume). For example, xeric perennial grassland species showed differences in acclimation to elevated CO2 concentra- tion which varied from marked downregulation in the grass species to upward regulation in the dicot species (Tuba et al. 1996a). This would be expected to lead to changes in species competition and dominance as at- mospheric CO2 concentration rises in the future. Although considerable data are available on short- term and long-term responses of plants to elevated CO2 (e.g. Ceulemans &amp; Mousseau 1994), there have been no reports on the long-term responses of an im- portant functional group, the desiccation-tolerant (DT) plants (Tuba et al. 1994). The desiccation process of DT lichen and moss species, occurring in dry grasslands (Tuba et al. 1996b) was shown to be slower, with upward regulation of net CO2 assimilation (Csin- talan et al. this volume). Whether this phenomenon would result in production (and cover) increase of these species is also interesting from the point of view of ecosystem functioning. Downward regulation has been observed at the biochemical level (Drake et al. 1997) with apparent feedback on the photochemical reaction rates (Barták et al., this volume). Down regulation among others may be coupled to the decreased leaf N content (Körner &amp; Miglietta 1994) on a weight basis. However, this change is cancelled out by the decreased specific leaf area, resulting in no change of leaf N-con- tent as a result of the high CO2 treatment on the leaf area basis (Soussana et al. 1996b). The conflicting ob- servations that high CO2 stimulates net CO2 uptake and production in some cases (Chen et al. 1996) but has no significant effect in others (Parton et al. 1995) may partially be related to species specific response (Stirling et al, Jongen &amp; Jones this volume). Elevated CO2 can exert a positive influence in CO2 x tempera- ture interactions as has been found in studies on photosynthetic gas exchange and chlorophyll fluores- cence (Casella et al. 1996, Nijs et al. 1996, Vu et al. 1997, Barták et al., this volume). Stornata and water relations It is currently assumed that stomatal aperture decreases with increasing CO2, with little or no effect on photosynthesis (Drake et al. 1997), but with a substan- tial increase in WUE which is expected to range be- tween 60 and 160% under doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Morison 1985). Decrease in stomatal density appears to be a common response, but in- creases and no change have been reported too. Grasses from carbon dioxide springs, certainly long acclimated to elevated carbon dioxide, display a lower stomatal conductance with respect to control (Bettarini et al. 1997), while stomatal density is unaffected in most of the species. The effect of stomatal response on the total stand water use may be negligible if LAI is significant- ly increased by elevated CO2 (Dugas et al. 1994); al- though there may be effects on the energy balance of the canopy. On the other hand, in forest trees there may be a substantial reduction in the leaf area per plant (Hattenschwiler et al. 1997), enhancing the effect of reduced stomatal conductance on canopy water use. The protecting effect of elevated CO2 against water stress under high temperatures (Thornley et al. 1996) is related to the increased water use efficiency (Tuba et al. 1996a) and osmotic adjustment (Menconi et al. this volume) in plants grown in high CO2 environment, although the osmotic response seems to vary through- out the growing season, and may be related to changes in photosynthetic efficiency (W. Oechel, pers. comm.).</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1997) 333 Some biochemical aspects Carbohydrates must play a significant role in the physiological acclimation to elevated CO2 (Stitt 1993). Such role of the carbohydrates is impossible to explain without a precise knowledge of regulation of car- bohydrate metabolism. In carbohydrate regulation the role of enzymes of sugar synthesis and breakdown are very important. The activity of key enzymes (fructose- 1 ,6-bisphosphatase = Fru- 1 ,6-P2-ase, fructose-2,6-bis- phosphate = Fru-2,6-P2, D-fructose-6- phosphate 1-phosphotransferase = PFP, phosphofructokinase = PFK) in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis and glyconeogenesis) has been studied in two differently acclimated C3 perennial species {Fes- tuca rupicola, Filipendula vulgaris). The decrease of Fru- 1 ,6-P2-ase activity in the plants grown at elevated CO2 reflects a greater proportion of glyconeogenesis over glycolysis (Nádas et al. this volume). There is an indication that the rate of glyconeogenesis decreases in the upward-regulated plants, while the intensity of breakdown processes (glycolysis) increases. This shift in the direction of breakdown processes may ensure that the plant is able to use up the excessive amount of carbohydrates resulting from increased photosyn- thesis. By contrast, in the downregulated plants the shift of the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in the direction of glyconeogenesis may be a major cause of starch accumulation and the downward acclimation of photosynthesis. The changes in the ratio of glycolysis/glyconeogenesis can alter through respira- tion the carbon balance and finally the production of the plant. Future research needs Processes in vegetation occur over a wide range of spa- tial and temporal scales but because of the current in- terest in global change there is a need to scale upwards to predict the responses to change. There may be general agreement that increasing global carbon dioxide concentrations and the changing climate will have direct physiological effects on grasslands, but the duration of these effects and their impact at the level of the population and ecosystem is still relatively un- known. This is largely because most of the experimen- tal work on grass responses to climate change has involved investigation of single plant responses over time periods of days to weeks. In order to understand how large geographical areas occupied by grasslands will respond to climate change, there is clearly a need to scale up from single plants and plots with dimen- sions in the order of 1 to 100 m2, to patches (100- 10000 m2), to landscapes (1-100 km2) and ultimately to regions (10000 km2) as well as from relatively short-term to long-term time scales (years to cen- turies). The scaling process involves taking informa- tion at one scale and using it to derive processes at another scale (Wessman 1992; Jarvis 1995). However, major problems with this approach are the non- linearity between processes and variables and the heterogeneities in properties that determine the rate of processes. Ultimately however, the key to scaling is determining what to ignore. The object is not to ana- lyse all of the smaller scale aspects of a process under observation, but to focus instead only on those that have direct importance to the scale under considera- tion (Wessman 1992). Bridging the gap between site- level ecological understanding and global scale phenomena will probably be best achieved using a combination of remote sensing studies, the use of geographic information systems and simulation modelling. Because of the uncertainties in predictions made by existing global models it is essential that modellers and experimentalists communicate new results suggesting mechanisms not included, or poorly described at present. In order to reduce the range of predicted responses and to determine which models are most ac- curate it is necessary to collect appropriate measure- ments from grassland ecosystems that can confirm or validate the projections of the models. In particular, these include flux measurements of carbon and water exchange over large areas of major grassland types. Measurements over the seasonal cycle and, periodical- ly, over several years to determine fluxes during years with different temperatures and amounts of precipita- tion are essential. These data can be used to determine whether measured carbon and water fluxes are consis- tent with values predicted by particular models. It is still widely recognised that modelling efforts are currently constrained by inadequate databases of ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 and altered climate. Consequently, experimental ecophysiology and ecosystem studies need to investigate the response of natural and agricultural grassland ecosystems, above and below ground, across broad climate gradients to elevated CO2, with particular emphasis on changes in relationships among environmental vari- ables such as temperature, moisture and nutrients. Par- ticular emphasis should be placed on carbon pool quantification over time and space. Also, in mixed C3- C4 ecosystems, determination of the differential responses among species (functional types) that affect productivity and interspecific competition leading to composition shifts requires investigation. Because past experiments have only been conducted over rela- tively short periods in the context of the ecological timescale, important aspects of the vegetation</page><page sequence="6">334 Nagy et al: Elevated air CO2 and grasslands response have not been identified. These changes are not only the result of changes in the relative propor- tions of genotypes due to differences in responsiveness but include invasion or extinction of species and per- haps most importantly human interaction altering the genetic makeup of communities.
