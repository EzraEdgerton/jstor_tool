Abstract: The extent to which atmospheric CO2 enrichment may influence alfalfa {Medicago sativa L.) water relations under non-limiting conditions of water and nutrient supply is examined. During the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons water relations were studied by monitoring both predawn and midday water potentials, the daily trend of stomatal conductance, and the occurrence of osmotic adjustment. Midday water potential was higher in plants grown under CO2 enrichment in comparison with plants grown under ambient CO2, while stomatal conductance decreased. On the contrary, high CO2 treatment had no effect on predawn water potential. Furthermore, an osmotic adjustment was evident in well- watered alfalfa plants exposed to high CO2 although other factors such as plant age and /or period of growing season should be taken into account. Introduction In recent years, an anthropogenic increase in atmos- pheric concentration of various "greenhouse" gases, so called for their ability to trap terrestrial radiation warming the atmosphere, has been well documented. In particular, since the mid 1 800' s the atmospheric car- bon dioxide concentration has increased by 70 |Limol mol"1 (Arnone &amp; Gordon 1990), and if no steps are taken to limit emissions its present value is expected to double within the next century (Bolin et al. 1986). This is predicted to cause both an increase in global mean temperature and changes in precipitation patterns (Houghton et al. 1990). There is agreement on the sen- sitivity of the Mediterranean environment to global change, including changes in temperature and water availability (Moreno &amp; Oechel 1995). In turn, the in- creasing CO2 concentration will also directly affect plant growth and yield whether the climate changes or not. The relationship between atmospheric CO2 con- centration and plant water relations has been studied by various authors on different plant species (Tyree &amp; Alexander 1993). However, the behaviour of alfalfa {Medicago sativa L.) under elevated CO2 has so far seldom been investigated. The purpose of this work was to fill this gap by studying the direct effects of a long-term CO2 enrichment on alfalfa water relations. Materials and methods Experimental setup During spring 1994 a set of open-top chambers (OTCs) were established at the experimental field of IATA-CNR (Rapolano Terme, Siena, Central Italy) on the Santa Cecilia farm. The farm belongs to Geogas, a mining company which extracts, purifies and bottles CO2 from natural vents. This allowed us to connect the air inlet of the OTCs directly to the company bulk con- tainer avoiding any risk of CO2 shortage during the ex- periment, which may be possible when purchasing CO2 in gas cylinders. The OTCs design, as well as the CO2 concentration control system were similar to that described by Ashenden et al. (1992). The dimension of the cylindrical OTCs were as follows: diameter 1.5 m; height 1.3 m; the walls were made in transparent PVC (Adriaplast, Milano, Italy). In spring of both 1994 and 1995 alfalfa was sown in pots. The 1994/95 ex-</page><page sequence="2">306 Menconi et al.: High CO2 and alfalfa perimental setup consisted of 8 OTCs, 4 enriched (600 ļjmol mol"1 of CO2) and 4 controls (ambient 350 ļimol mol"1 of CO2), in which both 1-year and 2-year-old plants were grown. Another set of plants was placed outside the chambers at normal atmospheric CO2 con- centration, in order to observe an "ambient environ- ment" control. Both inside and outside the chambers, the pots (9 litres each) were placed in tubs, with the upper rim of the pots at ground level. Each tub con- tained 12 pots, each one containing 5 plants. In order to maintain the soil at field capacity the pots were regularly watered each day. Harvests (4 cuts per sum- mer) were performed at the beginning of flowering, as it is done in Tuscany for field alfalfa crops. Water relations Plant - water relations were monitored by measuring the osmotic potential at full turgor OF^100), the predawn (p^w) anc* the midday (m^w) water poten- tials, and stomatal conductance (gs). a) In order to detect the occurrence of osmotic adjust- ment mechanisms under elevated CO2, osmotic poten- tial at full turgor was determined on 6 samples per treatment by the analysis of pressure-volume curves (Tyree &amp; Hammel 1972). These measurements were performed during both July and September 1994 regrowth cycles on 1 -year-old plants, and during July and September 1995 cycles on 1-year and 2-years old plants. Each sample consisted of approximately 10 cm of the terminal portion of a stem. Each sample was weighted after cutting, it was then quickly placed in- side a polyethylene sheath that was heat sealed leaving approximately 3 cm of stem protruding from this en- closure, thus providing a firm but not airtight seal. The protruding stem was fitted with a preweighted sap col- lection assembly. The base of the pressure chamber was lined with moist filter paper to minimize tissue water loss and leaf temperature fluctuations during pressure changes. The flow of nitrogen into the cham- ber was set at approximately 0.004 to 0.005 Mpa s"1 until fluid appeared on the cut surface of the stem. This initial water potential (balance pressure) was recorded and the exudation of fluid from the cut surface was ab- sorbed by the sap collection assembly. This pressure was maintained for 2 min.; after this exchange time, chamber pressure was slowly reduced to 0.1 to 0.2 Mpa below the balance pressure, the sap collection as- sembly was removed and sealed, and immediately weighted. The stem was then fitted with a new preweighted sap collection assembly before the cham- ber was slowly pressurized to predeterminate over- pressure of 0.4 Mpa still maintained for 2 min. This procedure was repeated 8 to 10 times, typically provid- ing data points in the range of positive turgor and in the region of zero turgor. The pressure-volume curves were then analysed by transforming the potential isotherm to l/HV versus the relative water content, RWC (Tyree &amp; Jarvis 1982). This approach provides a framework for analysis of tissue water relations in terms of the relationships between 4V, its component potentials (osmotic potential) and (turgor poten- tial), and RWC. Extrapolation of the linear portion of RWC=100% provides an estimation of H^1 b) both predawn and midday water potentials were determined on 10 leaves per treatment by using a pres- sure chamber (PMS mod. 1000, Corvallis, OR, USA). During both July and September 1995 regrowth cycles these measurements were repeated three times (after 8, 16, and 24 days from the last cut) on both 1-year and 2-years old plants; c) the daily trend of stomatal conductance was deter- mined on the abaxial surface of 6 leaves per treatment by using a steady-state porometer (LICOR 1600, Lin- coln, NE, USA). During September 1995 these measurements were performed on bright sunny days (at 10.30 a.m., 12.30 p.m., and 3.00 p.m., respectively) on both 1-year and 2-years old plants. To evaluate the CO2 effect on alfalfa water relations and its interactions between plant age and sampling time a multifactorial analysis of variance was per- formed. Results In both years the September months were charac- terized by lower temperatures, with respect to July months (Mean air temperatures: July 1994: 21.4 °C; September 1994: 16.5 °C; July 1995: 21.9 °C; Septem- ber 1995: 15.4 °C). During both September 1994 and 1995 regrowth cycles the occurrence of an osmotic adjustment in 1- year-old plants was found, while during the July cycles, as well as in the case of 2-year-old plants, no differences were found between the treatments (Table 1). The data relative to the predawn water potentials (p^w) of both 1-year and 2-years old plants are reported in Table 2. During both July and September 1995 regrowth cycles, pHV did not show any dif- ference between the treatments. On the contrary, in both July and September 1995 higher midday water potential (mH^y) values were found in 1-year and 2-year-old plants grown under high CO2 concentration (Table 3).</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 307 i no Table 1.

Furthermore, the occurrence of a significant interaction between CO2, plant age and sampling time on osmotic potential at full turgor (4V00) was found (Table 5). Discussion As a consequence of possible future changes in precipitation patterns, studying water relations under high CO2 on both natural and cropped plants has be- come a vital area of interest. From the literature avail- able on this topic, under water stress conditions the capacity of plants exposed to high CO2 to withstand water stress is usually related to the partial closure of stornata together with the occurrence of osmotic ad- justment mechanisms (Conroy et al. 1988). In par- ticular, increased concentrations of solutes in leaves of plants growing under above-ambient CO2 conditions are credited with the maintenance of higher relative water content (RWC) and turgor potential 0Fp). The occurrence of an osmotic adjustment under high CO2 is reported by several authors in various plant species (Thomas &amp; Harvey 1983, Conroy et al. 1988, Sasek &amp; Strain 1989), while Reekie &amp; Bazzaz (1989) found no correlation between increasing CO2 concentrations and osmotic potential, attributing their finding to the well-watered condition of the plants. On the contrary, our findings evidence how the occurrence of osmotic adjustment in leaves of alfalfa growing under high CO2 may also be possible under well- watered condi- tions, although this behaviour was only evident during both September 1994 and 95 regrowth cycles on 1- year-old plants (Table 1). The relationship between the</page><page sequence="4">308 Menconi et al.: High CO2 and alfalfa occurrence of an osmotic adjustment under high CO2, plant age and period of growing season might be, on the other hand, explained in terms of source-sink rela- tions. Indeed, the absence of any osmotic adjustment during all the July regrowth cycles might be a conse- quence of the higher growth rate shown by these plants (Raschi et al. 1997, in this volume) both in terms of above-ground dry matter and leaf area, that was providing a sink for assimilates alternative to the ac- cumulation of osmotically active solutes in the tissues. The absence of any osmotic adjustments under high CO2 conditions was also found in rape plants in which the measurements were performed during the period of maximal growth (Menconi et al. 1996). The absence of osmotic adjustment in 2-year-old plants may be attri- buted to a downward acclimation of photosynthesis that limits the amount of assimilates (data not reported). A greater retention of high water potential under elevated CO2 has been reported by different authors for several C3 and C4 grasses (Rogers et al. 1984, Tol- ley &amp; Strain 1984, Wray &amp; Strain 1986). This be- haviour may be related to a correspondent decrease in the stomatal conductance, probably due to the partial closure of stornata under increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Tyree &amp; Alexander 1993). Elevated CO2 has been reported to ameliorate rnHV in water stressed soybean while in well watered conditions no differences were detected between CO2 treated and un- treated plants (Prior et al. 1991). This effect has been partially attributed to a more limited water extraction by treated plants, due to the reduced transpiration. In this experiment the retention of higher midday water potential under high CO2 (Table 3) although limited to a few bars, was statistically significative, and was re- lated to a significant decrease in stomatal conductance. The values of p^V (Table 2) indicate that night recovery is similar for treated and nontreated plants. In this respect, the dynamics of root pressure under elevated CO2 may be an interesting topic for further research.
