Abstract: Results from a case study with perennial ryegrass stands grown during 27 months on a soil at two N fertilizer suppplies in ambient or in elevated CO2 and at outdoor temperature or +3°C, with (or without) a summer water limitation are discussed. Elevated CO2 effects on the above-ground productivity of the grass sward and on the herbage quality were found to be partly mediated by plant-soil interactions. An increased allocation of growth to the roots was observed under elevated CO2 and, despite an enhancement of carbon turnover in the soil macro-organic fractions, a supplemental sequestration of carbon occurred below-ground. Nitrogen immobilization in the soil macro-organic matter was enhanced under elevated CO2 and the net mineralization rate was reduced. These changes in the soil N cycle under elevated CO2 led to a reduction in the availability of inorganic N to the grass (decline in the N nutrition index) and, therefore, to a decline in the harvest index. In case of a combined increase in CO2 concentration and in air temperature, the decline in the sward productivity during summer was offset by an increase during early spring and late autumn. A supplemental 3°C in elevated CO2 mitigated the changes in the soil N cycle, without diminishing the sequestration of below-ground carbon, due apparently to the reduction in the soil water content, which partly counterbalanced the positive effect of an increased air temperature on SOM decomposition. Introduction As shown by direct measurements (Keeling et al. 1995), the atmospheric CO2 concentration is currently rising and it is expected that it will rise up to 530 (iL L 1 [CO2] in 2050, and could exceed 700 (iL L"1 [CO2] in 2100 (Watson et al. 1990). This increase in atmos- pheric CO2, with parallel increases in other 'green- house gases', is predicted to produce an increase in mean global temperatures of ca. 4°C by 2100 (Watson et al. 1990), although recent models show that this temperature increase might be smaller (0.2 °C per decade) due to the cooling action of sulphate aerosols (Mitchell et al. 1995). From an agronomic view, the quantity, quality and timing of forage production in grassland ecosystems could be affected by climatic changes. From an en- vironmental view, water drainage, nitrate leaching as well as trace gas fluxes (CO2, N2O) could be modified. From an ecological view, the high species diversity found in some temperate grasslands, as well as the relatively short stature of the plants makes this system an appropriate model for the study of interactions among global changes, biological diversity and eco- system functioning. There is considerable variation between C3 species in the responses of photosynthesis, growth and root frac- tion to elevated CO2 (Luo et al. 1994; Poorter 1993). Lolium , a cool temperature forage crop, which is among the most common C3 grasses in European pas- tures, has shown an intrinsic limitation of growth at en- hanced CO2, in spite of increases of photosynthesis, when grown in artificial swards or as isolated plants (Gay and Hauck 1994; Nijs et al. 1989; Ryle et al. 1992). With perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), the impacts of elevated CO2 have been assessed with spaced plants or simulated swards grown in a con- trolled environment (e.g. Ryle et al. 1992; Schenck et al. 1995) or with pot grown plants (Nijs et al. 1988; 1989), which may not have a sufficient rooting volume (Arp 1991).</page><page sequence="2">224 Soussana &amp; Loiseau: Plant-soil interactions The carbon balance of pot-grown perennial ryegrass swards was previously studied by Nijs et al. (1989) and, recently, Schapendonk &amp; Goudriaan (1995) reported the carbon balance of an established perennial ryegrass sward over a full year. However, in these studies the effects of an elevated temperature was not considered and the water and nitrogen supplies were non limiting. More recently, major limitations of productivity through shortages of e.g. nitrogen and water were investigated year round under elevated CO2 with this common temperate grass species (Casel- la et al. 1996; Soussana et al. 1996; Casella &amp; Sous- sana 1997). Productivity in most temperate perennial ecosystems is usually limited by moisture and/or nutrient availability. Thus changes in water use efficiency, or more efficient use of other nutrients, would enhance ecosystem productivity. In particular, in a vegetation that is exposed frequently to water stress, the major response to elevated CO2 is likely to be increased productivity from increased water use efficiency (Ham et al. 1995; Owensby et al. 1993). However, a rise in air temperature could lead to an increase in the evaporative demand and to larger water losses through évapotranspiration. Nitrogen limitation is a strong constraint for the productivity of most temperate grasslands. Some authors (Bazzaz 1990; Newton 1991) have postulated that increased production under elevated CO2 will diminish over time as N becomes more limiting due to increased growth. There are some reports indicating that both the C:N ratio of the plant material and the photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency increase in elevated CO2 (reviewed by Luo et al., 1994). Never- theless, one can not expect a strong increase in biomass production under elevated CO2 without an appropriate increase in nitrogen assimilation either from the avail- able soil N pool or from the atmosphere (Comins &amp; McMurtrie 1993; Gifford 1994). Concerning the soil, an increased N demand for the decomposition of soil residues with a large C:N ratio (Owensby 1993; Gorissen et al. 1995) might result under elevated CO2 in a larger N-sink of the whole grassland ecosystem. In addition, there may be a feed- back mechanism in which elevated CO2 causes an in- crease in carbon-rich substrate release into the rhizosphere by non-symbiotic plants, leading to nitrogen sequestration by the expanded microflora and a consequent nutritional limitation of plant growth (Diaz et al. 1993). Such a nitrogen limitation of growth in elevated CO2 may affect root/shoot partitioning. In temperate grassland ecosystems, as thè shoots are periodically grazed or clipped, carbon sequestration occurs mostly below-ground. Under elevated CO2, several factors could contribute to enhance this below- ground C sequestration: i) a sustained increase in plant productivity (Field et al. 1992, Gifford 1994), ii) an in- creased allocation of photosynthates below-ground (Luo et al. 1994) and, iii) a decreased decomposability of roots and of plant residues due to a larger C:N ratio (Owensby 1993; Ross et al. 1995). On the other hand, an increased air temperature may lead to an increase in soil respiration and in the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (Jenkinson et al. 1991). Grassland ecosystems account for approximately 12 % of the total carbon storage in the continental biosphere (Schlesinger 1991). Therefore, a stimulation of the below-ground carbon sequestration in temperate grassland soils could exert a negative feed-back on the current rise of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, thereby contributing to the terrestrial sink for carbon (Keeling et al. 1995). Most of the plant and soil experimental studies to date concern small parts of the C or N cycles and were run under artificial conditions and in microcosms. In the present paper, we shall review some of the results ob- tained in a long-term experiment (Casella et al. 1996; Soussana et al. 1996), with perennial ryegrass stands grown on a soil at two N fertilizer suppplies in ambient or in elevated CO2 and at outdoor temperature or +3°C, with (or without) a summer water limitation. From these results, we will discuss the possible agronomic impacts of climatic changes on temperate grass swards and the role of plant-soil interactions for the C and N fluxes under elevated CO2. Materials and methods A facility consisting of three 70 m plastic tunnels covered with a polyethylene (120 |im) film, with out- door temperature and CO2 concentration tracking devices was used for the experiment (Casella et al., 1996). The climate inside each tunnel was controlled to obtain the following conditions (Table 1, see also Casella et al. 1996 for additional details): - outdoor climate (350), - elevated CO2 (ambient + 350 (iL L"1 [CO2]) (700), - elevated CO2 and temperature increase (am- bient + 350 |iL L"1 [C02] and +3°C) (700+). In September 1991, 87 swards consisting of perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne L., cv Préférence) were</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 225 Table 1.

(1996) 2 sown in 0.5 m (45 cm deep) containers, filled with a well homogenised loamy soil (1 % organic matter, C:N = 10, pH 6.9), and were grown outdoor. In March 1993, 18 months after sowing, these swards were as- signed randomly to the 3 highly ventilated plastic tun- nels: 350, 700 and 700+. From March 1993 to June 1995, the swards were grown continuously under the 350, 700 and 700+ climatic conditions. All swards were cut simultaneously at 4 cm height in May, June, July, September and October. An addition- al first spring cut was also made on April 15th whenever the sward height was above 4 cm. To avoid any growth limitation, each year, P, K and S were sup- plied at non limiting rates. Two rates of nitrogen fer- tilizer (NH4NO3) were supplied in split applications: 160 (N-) and 530 (N+) kg N ha"1 y"1 (Casella et al. 1996). Water supply was adjusted to simulate the average changes in water availability that usually occur in our site: good water availability during spring; summer water deficit; autumn and winter drainage. All swards were irrigated twice weekly in summer (June to Sep- tember) and once weekly during the rest of the year with the same irrigation volumes. These were calcu- lated as follows: - during the spring growing period, that is from mid-April to the June cut, the irrigation rate was equal to that supplied to a fully irrigated N+ sward in the 350 tunnel, - during the July and September regrowths, the irrigation rate was equal, to 70 and 50%, res- pectively, of that supplied to the fully irrigated control, - from mid-September to mid-April, drainage was obtained by supplying the same amount of water in excess to all swards (10 L per con- tainer, each week). A total of 628 and 666 mm water was supplied to the swards during the growing seasons in 1993 and 1994, respectively (Casella et al. 1996). Using a lysimeter approach, the évapotranspiration, the soil water balance, the productivity (dry-matter yield) and the water use efficiency of the grass swards were measured (Casella et al. 1996). At harvest, the cut leaf material was dried (80°C, 48 h), weighed and its total nitrogen concentration was determined according to Kjeldahl. The phytomass of the roots and stubbles was determined on soil cores, sampled from one con- tainer per climate and per N treatment on 8 occasions (Soussana et al. 1996). One week after and one week before cutting, around 12:00 h solar time, leaf lamina samples were freeze dried, extracted first in alcohol: water and then in dis- tilled water. After purification, water soluble car- bohydrates (WSC) were quantified by HPLC (Casella and Soussana, 1997). At cutting date, the harvested material was dried and ground to pass through a 1 mm grid. The dry matter was fractionated into neutral (NDF) and acid (ADF) detergent fibers, according to Goering and Van Soest (1970). Lignin was determined on ADF according to Jarrige (1961). Hemicellulose and cellulose were determined on the filtrates from ADF and lignin residues (Besle et al. 1981). Dry-mat- ter degradation in-situ , in a fistulated cow, was deter- mined by the nylon bag method (Demarquilly &amp; Chenost 1969). Ten days after the start of the regrowth and before cut- ting, adult tiller densities were counted on six row seg- ments per treatment and 30 randomly sampled adult tillers were analyzed for: leaf blade weight per unit length, sheath weight per unit length and daughter tiller biomass. Using a computer-controlled open-flow system, canopy gas exchanges were measured simultaneously in each tunnel on one N- and one N+ grass sward during 2 to 3 days each week from April to October in 1993 and 1994 (Casella &amp; Soussana 1997). A fraction of the air flowing through the shoot enclosure was pumped at a constant flow rate through the soil column of the container. From the quantity of air passing through the soil and the difference between the CO2 concentration of the mixed air in the enclosure and that at the outlet of the air-drain, the CO2 production rates in the soil can be calculated separately from the gas ex- changes in the canopy (Van de Geijn et al. 1994).</page><page sequence="4">226 Soussana &amp; Loi seau: Plant-soil interactions The soils were sampled on 6 occasions during the time course of the experiment, from March 1993 to June 1995. In the top-soil (0-15 cm), the root phytomass was recovered and three free macro-organic fractions (MOM) (&gt;1 cm, 1-10 mm, 200-1000 |X) were sepa- rated. The top soil layer contained, on average, 84% of the total below-ground organic matter above 200 'i. In the control tunnel, some of the ryegrass swards were labelled, from sunrise to sunset, during two days with 13C02 at an atom-excess of +0.28 %. This pulse labell- ing procedure was repeated twice during each regrowth in the growing season. The elevated CO2 treatments (700 and 700+) were continuously labelled by the addition of fossil-fuel derived CO2 (at -40 to -50 8 3C). At the beginning of the experiment, the isotopie composition of the carbon in the stubbles, roots and soil macro-organic matter (MOM) was at -32 813C. The carbon fixed in the plant material during the ex- periment was, on average, at -14 813C in the pulse labelled controls and at -54 Ô13C in the elevated CO2 (700 and 700+) treatments. 13 The C atom abundance, expressed by comparison with the PDB standard in delta units (Farquhar 1989) and the elemental C concentration of the harvests and of the plant and soil organic matter fractions were analysed, after total combustion, using a mass spectrometer coupled with an elemental analyser. Five periodic application of 15N-labelled mineral fer- tilizer at two levels, of 159 and 533 kgN ha"1 year"1 were used to characterize the N assimilation, the N al- location in the plant and the N immobilization, through the amounts of N in the soil macro-organic fractions. Possible agronomic impacts of climatic changes on temperate grass swards Water fluxes In this study, the long-term impacts of climatic chan- ges on the water use of perennial grass swards were simulated by supplying the same amount of water to all swards from the three climatic treatments (Table 2). The water use efficiency of the grass swards increased in elevated CO2, on average, by 17 to 30% (Casella et al. 1996). Elevated CO2 slightly reduced the évapo- transpiration during the growing season and increased drainage by 9% during winter. During the growing season, the soil moisture content at the high N supply declined gradually in the control climate, down to 20- 30% of the water holding capacity at the last cut (Sep- tember) before rewatering. This decline was partly alleviated under elevated CO2 in the first, but not in the second year (Casella et al. 1996). Under these ex- perimental conditions, the soil water holding capacity • was only a small fraction (approximately 7%) of the total water supplied by irrigation during one growing season. Therefore, the differences in soil moisture developing (or not) over the season were enhanced (or offset) by relatively small cumulative changes in the ET between CO2 treatments. Both during the winter period and during the growing season drainage was significantly reduced by a sup- plemental 3°C in elevated CO2 (Table 2). In case of a 3°C global warming, this reduction in drainage (by 22 to 30% at 700+ compared to 350) would have a major impact on the water fluxes at the field, catchment and ecosystem scale. Forage production During both years, elevated CO2 increased the annual dry-matter yield of the swards, by 19% at N- and by 14% at N+ (Table 2). Elevated CO2 modified yield to a variable extent during the growing season: a small, and sometime not significant effect (+6%, on average) was obtained in spring and in autumn, while the sum- mer growth response was stronger (+48%, on average). In elevated CO2, the temperature increase ef- fect on the annual dry-matter yield was not significant, due to a gain in dry-matter yield in spring and in autumn which was compensated for by a lower sum- mer productivity. The elevated CO2 effect on the dry-matter yield in- creased with air temperatures above 14.5°C and was promoted by a larger soil moisture in elevated com- pared to ambient CO2 (Casella et al. 1996). However, the magnitude of the changes in the soil water status were small in elevated CO2 and therefore interacted lit- tle with the direct effects of elevated CO2 on the above-ground productivity, which were mainly temperature dependent. In case of a combined increase in CO2 concentration and in air temperature, the faster depletion of soil water during spring led to an earlier onset of the soil water deficit in summer. The potential for a large positive ef- fect of elevated CO2 on DM yield during summer was not likely to be reached in case of a 3°C warming, due to the negative effects of low soil moistures and above- optimal temperatures on the productivity of perennial ryegrass. On the other hand, the extension of the growth period in early spring and late autumn at +3°C compensated for the depression in DM yield during summer (Casella et al. 1996). Nitrogen balance of the grass sward The nitrogen nutrition of the grass sward was studied by Soussana et al. (1996) at two sub-optimal (160 and 530 kg N ha"1 y"1) and one non-limiting (1000 kg N</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 21(1 997) 227 Table 2.

Elevated C02 depressed the annual nitrogen yield of the sward by 20 and 14% in 3993 and 1994, respectively. At cutting date, elevated CO2 reduced by 25 to 33%, on average, the leaf N concentration per unit mass (Table 2). The concentration of organic N in plants must exceed a certain minimum or critical concentration if maxi- mum growth rate is to be obtained, in a grass sward, the critical leaf N concentration declines with the sward shoot biomass according to a power law (Lemaire &amp; Salette 1 984; Greenwood et al. 1 990). The ratio of the actual to the critical shoot N concentration indicates the nitrogen nutrition index of the sward (Lemaire et al. 1989), which is independent from the sward biomass. In good agreement with Lemaire et al. (1989), under our experimental conditions, with the non-limiting N fertilizer supply, the leaf N concentration (% N) declined with the shoot dry-matter (DM) according to highly significant power models in ambient (% N = 4.9</page><page sequence="6">228 Soussana &amp; Loiseau: Plant-soil interactions DM "° 38) and in elevated (% N = 5.3 DM "° 52) C02. The difference between these two models was sig- nificant and indicated a lower critical leaf N concentra- tion in elevated than in ambient CO2 for high, but not for low values of shoot biomass (Soussana et al. 1996). With the sub-optimal N fertilizer supplies, the nitrogen nutrition index of the grass sward, calculated as the ratio of the actual to the critical leaf N concentration (Lemaire et al. 1989), was significantly reduced in elevated CO2. This indicated a lower inorganic N availability for the grass plants in elevated CO2, which was also apparent from the significant declines in the annual nitrogen yield of the grass sward and in the nitrate leaching during winter (Soussana et al. 1996). Thus, the grass leaf N concentration was modified under elevated CO2 in two different ways i) through a decline in the leaf N concentration under non-limiting N supply (regulation at the whole plant level) and ii) through a decline in the availability of inorganic nitrogen at sub*optimal N fertilizer supply (feed-back from the soil). Forage quality The effects of elevated CO2 (700 ppm) and of a 3°C increase in air temperature on the chemical composi- tion and on the in-situ digestibility of perennial ryegrass were studied by Soussana et al. (1997) for the May and June cuts. After one year exposure to elevated CO2, the WSC concentration in the lamina was multiplied, on average, by a factor of 2 to 3 (Table 2). A very large increase in the fructan concentration (+357%) was ob- served in elevated CO2, whereas the corresponding in- crease in the hexose and sucrose concentration was moderate (+33%) and occured only at N+. A 3°C temperature increase in elevated CO2 reduced sig- nificantly the WSC and the fructan concentrations and increased, at N-, the hexose and sucrose concentra- tions. The content of lignin in the fiber was slightly reduced in elevated CO2 but was increased by a supplemental 3°C. The in-situ dry-matter degradation was reduced by the temperature increase, especially at the low N supply (Table 2). This decrease is consistent with that of 0.64 percent per °C reported by Wilson and Wong (1982). In agreement with the report by Akin et al. ( 1 995), with a C3 grass of a high forage quality for ruminants, these results show that elevated CO2 and temperature in- crease had only minor impacts on the digestibility and on the fiber composition of the cut material. Neverthe- less, the large increase in the WSC concentration of the leaf laminae in elevated CO2 could lead to a faster digestion in the rumen. Also, the 25-33% decline in the Kjeldahl-N concentration of the harvested material, previously reported by Soussana et al. (1996), is likely to reduce the nitrogen value of the grass forage and, hence, to increase the needs for supplement feed. Taken together, these results show that, under a cutting regime, an increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentra- tion led to a temperature dependent increase in the above-ground productivity of perennial ryegrass swards. The increase in the water use efficiency (per unit of C assimilated) partly alleviated the summer water limitation of productivity, thereby reducing the seasonal variability of the forage production. Never- theless, elevated C02 had only minor impacts on the water use per unit ground area. No interactions between the CO2 and N supply effects were observed for the above-ground productivity. With sub-optimal N supplies, elevated CO2 depressed the annual nitrogen yield and reduced the total nitrogen concentration of the leaves. For grazing animals with a strong nitrogen demand (e.g. milking cows, lambs), this decline in the nitrogen value of the grass forage would increase the need for supplements. In case of a combined increase in CO2 concentration and in air temperature with no change in the irrigation pattern, the timing of the forage production was modified. Under our experimental conditions, the an- nual productivity did not vary, as the decline in the productivity during summer was offset by an increase during early spring and late autumn. An increase of the air temperature, mitigated the changes in the soluble carbohydrate and protein contents of the perennial grass forage which were observed in elevated CO2 at ambient temperature. The large decline in the water drainage at +3°C in elevated CO2 implies that ground- water resources might become depleted, possibly restricting the availability of water for irrigation. However, the results from this case study should be ex- trapolated with caution for at least three reasons: i) other forage species, and more complex grassland vegetations, may obviously react differently to an in- crease in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, ii) the increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration and in the air temperature are expected to take place during several decades and not in one single step. Whether a long-term acclimation of the individual plants, or an adaptation of the plant populations will take place, or not, is not known.</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1997) 229 iii) grassland vegetation structure and productivity are strongly determined by the prevailing human interven- tions by management. Farmers may need to adapt their land management (e.g. land use, grazing or cutting management, fertilization, irrigation) to cope with the consequences of climatic changes. For example, in case of a 3°C warming, farmers could gradually replace in the sown grasslands Lolium perenne by grass species that are more resilient to soil water deficit (e.g. Dactylis glomerata , Festuca arundinacea). Moreover, policies designed to reduce the impacts of feedbacks from agricultural systems on future global change (i.e. mitigation) may also affect land manage- ment by farmers (reviewed by Campbell et al. 1997). A better knowledge of the mechanisms of the interac- tions between elevated CO2, temperature and grassland ecosystems will, however, be needed before such adaptation or mitigation strategies can be en- visaged. In particular, long-term studies are required to establish the possible role of plant-soil interactions on the grassland ecosystem functioning under elevated co2. The role of plant-soil interactions for the C and N fluxes in elevated CO2 Root: shoot balance under elevated CO2 In temperate grassland ecosystems, as the shoots are periodically grazed or clipped, carbon inputs to the soil are mostly due to the root and stubble litter and/or to root exudates. Changes in the allocation of photosyn- thates between the harvested shoots and the roots and stubbles may therefore trigger modifications of the soil carbon and nitrogen cycles which will, in turn, affect plant growth and, presumably, root: shoot allocation. Soussana et al. (19%) reported a large decline in the harvest index of the grass sward in elevated CO2 due, on average to a 45-52% increase in the root phy tomass. In the same way, a smaller share of the plant total nitrogen was harvested by cutting, due, on average to a 25-41% increase in the N contents of the roots (Table 2). This increase in the root and stubble fraction of perennial ryegrass in elevated CO2 could be inter- preted according to different paradigms: as a change in the functional equilibrium between roots and shoots, due to an increased assimilate supply by the leaves and/or to a reduced N supply by the soil; or as an in- creased assimilate supply with a limiting growth rate of the shoots, leading to increased growth of the roots and stubbles (Luo et al. 1994). In our experimental conditions, the first hypothesis (functional equilibrium between roots and shoots) is supported by the 14-15% decline in the nitrogen nutri- tion index (I'N) of the grass in elevated CO2, when grown on a soil, with a sub-optimal N supply. Moreover, the changes in harvest and in nitrogen nutri- tion index between ambient and elevated CO2 were also positively correlated (Soussana et al. 1996). This may imply that the decline in the N nutrition index of the grass sward in elevated CO2 caused a shift in its DM and nitrogen distribution towards more roots (or stubbles) and less leaves. According to the second hypothesis (limiting growth rate of the shoots), ryegrass above-ground growth response to elevated CO2 is not limited by assimilate availability, but by another factor like the growth potential of the shoots. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the growth response of perennial ryegrass to elevated CO2 was found to be temperature depen- dent, with a larger response at temperatures which maximize shoot growth in ambient CO2 (Casella et al. 1996). A method for studying the shoot morphogenesis of perennial ryegrass under climate change was previous- ly reported by Soussana et al. (1994). The average leaf emission rate and the average number of green leaves per tiller were not modified significantly in elevated compared to ambient CO2. At N-, the tiller number in- creased significantly in elevated CO2, by +68% on average, presumably due to an incomplete light inter- ception (Varlet-Grancher et al. 1993) in this low N supply treatment. At the high N supply, on the con- trary, there was no significant increase of the tiller den- sity in elevated CO2 (Soussana, Casella and Loiseau, unpublished results). The average leaf length and the average lamina elon- gation rate were significantly depressed in elevated compared to ambient CO2 at N-, possibly due to a lower inorganic N availability in elevated CO2 (Sous- sana et al. 1996). At N+, the elevated CO2 effect on the the lamina elongation rate was initially positive at the start of the regrowth period and became negative ap- proximately one week before cutting (Soussana, Casella and Loiseau, unpublished results), presumably due to the aggravation of the N nutritional constraint in elevated, compared to ambient CO2. Due to the complexity of these morphogenetic regula- tions, a modelling approach would be needed to define the growth potential of the grass in ambient and in elevated CO2. Some recent models of grass growth (e.g. Van Loo 1993; Bouman et al. 1996) incorporate the possibility of a sink limitation of shoot growth. However, these models assume a constant root frac- tion. On the other hand, Hilbert et al. (1991) have used a cost-benefit approach to determine the root: shoot</page><page sequence="8">230 Soussana &amp; Loiseau: Plant-soil interactions ratio and the leaf nitrogen concentration that maximize whole-plant relative growth rate under ambient or elevated CO2. Such models would be helpful to ana- lyse the possible roles of a sink limitation of shoot growth and of a soil-induced nitrogen deficiency to ac- count for the increase in the root fraction of the grass under elevated CO2. Carbon accumulation and turnover below-ground Casella and Soussana (1997) studied the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature increase on the C balance of an established grass sward. Canopies grown in elevated CO2 for 14 to 27 months photosynthetised significantly less rapidly, in both elevated and normal CO2 concentrations, than their counterparts developed in ambient CO2, but the magnitude of this effect was small (-8 to -13%). This indicated that the down- regulation of leaf photosynthesis in elevated CO2 was not the major cause of the relatively low increase in the annual dry-matter yield of the grass swards. Light interception during regrowth was significantly promoted in elevated CO2 at the high (N+) but not at the low (N-) nitrogen-fertilizer supply and the elevated CO2 effect on the daily net C assimilation was greater at N+ compared to N- (+42 and +28%, respectively). At N-, both in ambient and in elevated CO2 the above and below-ground respirations accounted for 37-38 and 20-23% of the gross assimilation (Ag), wheras the above (Yc) and below-ground (Bb) carbon accumula- tions amounted, respectively, to 14-15 and 32-33% of Ag (Table 2). Therefore, the fate of the photosynthetic C was similar in ambient and in elevated CO2 at N-. Increasing the N supply resulted in a shift of C ac- cumulation from the below-ground compartment towards the harvested shoots. At N+, elevated CO2 in- creased the share of the photosynthetic carbon that was accumulated below-ground, since Bb accounted for 24% of Ag at 700, compared to 16% at 350 (Table 2). Therefore, during the growing season, the fraction of the assimilated carbon that was stored below-ground was not modified in elevated CO2 at N- and was slight- ly increased at N+. As a result of these elevated CO2 effects on the carbon balance of the grass swards, from April to October of each year, a supplemental below-ground carbon storage of 1 .3 and 2.7 1 C ha" 1 occurred in elevated CO2 at N- and N+, respectively (Table 2). The increase in the root mass of the grass sward in elevated CO2 (Sous- sana et al. 1996) contributed to this supplemental below-ground C sequestration. However, roots accounted only for a fraction (1.2 and 1 .8 1 C ha"1 at N- and N+, respectively) of the total sup- plemental below-ground carbon storage (2.8 and 5.4 1 C ha"1 at N- and N+, Table 2) in elevated CO2, which indicated that part of the supplemental below-ground C sequestration also occured in the soil organic matter. At the end of the experiment, the carbon accumulation in the soil macro-organic matter (MOM) reached +1.1, +2.0 and +2.0 t C ha"1 at 350, 700 and 700+, respec- tively (Table 3). The C:N ratio of the below-ground phytomass and of the soil MOM fractions increased significantly in elevated CO2 and decreased with a supplemental 3°C in elevated CO2 (Table 3) (un- piblished results by P. Loiseau and J.F. Soussana). 1 ^ The 6 C signature of the soil fractions allowed to cal- culate the below-ground accumulation of 'new* C (i.e. carbon assimilated during the climate change experi- ment) in the phytomass and MOM fractions of the top soil (0-15 cm). During the 27 months of the experi- ment, elevated CO2 led to an average supplemental ac- cumulation of 'new' C of 0.75 and 0.25 t C ha"1 y"1 in the below-ground phytomass and in the MOM, respec- tively (Table 3). Using a first order kinetics, a mean turnover time (i.e. for the replacement of the 'old' carbon by the 'new' carbon assimilated during the climate change experi- ment) was calculated. In ambient CO2, this mean turn- over time reached 12 and 21 months in the phytomass and in the MOM, respectively. Under elevated CO2, the corresponding turnover times declined significant- ly, down to 9 and 17 months, respectively (unpublihed results by P. Loiseau and J. F. Soussana). Therefore, the turnover of these coarse organic fractions was strongly enhanced in elevated CO2. Hence, on average of the two N supplies, elevated CO2 stimulated both the carbon inputs to the soil and the carbon outputs caused by organic matter's decay. At N+, a faster litter carbon decay was measured for the material accumulated before the start of the climate change experiment. This stimulation of the OM's decay rate in elevated CO2 was observed despite the greater C:N ratios of the organic inputs to the soil. Therefore, it can not be explained by the changes in the litter quality and should be ascribed: i) to a greater lit- ter carbon input under elevated CO2, resulting from the stimulation of root turnover; ii) to possible changes in the soil biological activity under elevated CO2, caused by an increased production of easily metabolizable carbon (i.e. root exudates). Nevertheless, due to the greater stimulation in elevated CO2 of the carbon inputs, compared to the carbon out- puts, below-ground C accumulation was enhanced</page><page sequence="9">232 Soussana &amp; Loiseau: Plant-soil interactions an increased N immobilization. These features were accentuated in the case of the NDFS. A supplemental 3°C in elevated CO2 increased the har- vested NDFS, with no significant effect on the NDFF. It decreased the total assimilated N, increased the rela- tive allocation in the plant to the benefit of the harvests and had no effect on the total N immobilized in the MOM. Particularly at N+, the temperature effect al- leviated the CO2 effect in numerous parts of the N cycle (Table 3). These results show that the nitrogen immobilization in the soil was increased under elevated CO2. Therefore, plant - soil competition for the use of mineral N resour- ces restricted the availability of inorganic N for plant growth. These data are thus consistent with the hypothesis of a negative feedback of elevated CO2 on the nitrogen nutrition of the grass sward, through a decreased net nitrogen mineralization in the soil. This depression of the soil nitrogen cycle, which led to the decline in the above-ground nitrogen yield, apparently resulted from the enhancement of carbon accumula- tion below-ground, in the soil of undisturbed grassland ecosystems. Conclusion This case study shows that plant-soil interactions are likely to play a key-role for the response of temperate grass ecosystems to the current rise in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. With soil-grown ryegrass swards, the increase in leaf photosynthesis under elevated CO2 leads to a large increase of root growth and, hence, of the below-ground carbon deposition. In turn, this results in the faster turnover of the soil macro-organic fractions and in the sequestration of supplemental car- bon below-ground. Since inorganic nitrogen is needed to sustain the process of OM decomposition, the in- creased turnover of carbon under elevated CO2 leads to an increased nitrogen immobilization in the soil macro-organic matter. This supplemental N im- mobilization in the detritic pathway could be accom- panied by a supplemental N immobilization in the microbial biomass and in the microbial by-products and, presumably, in the stabilized organic matter. N fluxes are modified both in the sward and in the soil- sward ecosystem under elevated CO2: i) for the same N-fertilizer supply, smaller amounts of N are accumu- lated in the harvests and, possibly, in the whole plant; ii) N leaching during winter declines and iii) for the same fertilizer-N supply, a reduction of the soil net N mineralization was calculated from the 15N data. These changes induce a limitation in the supply of in- organic N by the soil and, accordingly, reduce the nitrogen nutrition index of the grass sward under elevated CO2. This soil-induced N deficiency con- tributes to increase the root fraction of the grass and, thereby, stimulates the litter carbon inputs to the soil. In this sense, the imbalance between the C and N cycles under elevated CO2, which is primarily induced by an increase in leaf photosynthesis, is reinforced in the short-term (2-3 years) by plant-soil interactions that result in greater carbon inputs to the soil and smaller nitrogen outputs from the soil, thereby, caus- ing the sequestration of increased amounts of C and N below-ground. However, these conclusions should not be extrapo- lated directly to herbaceous vegetations that are mineral-poor or that include some legume species. Mooney et al. (1991) have hypothetised that mineral poor ecosystems are likely to respond less to elevated CO2 than mineral-rich or xeric systems and this hypothesis is supported by results from Mediterranean old-fields (Navas et al. 1995) and from the Arctic tundra (Grulke et al. 1990). Moreover, with grass- legume mixtures the positive response of the symbiotic N2 fixation to the increased N sink of the ecosystem is likely to offset the imbalance between the C and N cycles (Soussana &amp; Hartwig 1997).
