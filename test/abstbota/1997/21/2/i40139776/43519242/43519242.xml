         <abstract>
            <p>Eight British native plant species were grown for 125 to 140 days in a suite of Solardome glasshouses set up to provide a factorial combination of two levels of CO₂ (ambient/ambient + 340 ppm), two levels of temperature (ambient/ambient + 3° C) with two replicates of each CO₂ × temperature combination. Species provided two contrasting examples (a grass and forb) each of a competitor, stress tolerator, a ruderal (associated with highly disturbed environments) and mixed strategist. Treatment effects on plant canopy development were assessed at ca. weekly intervals over a twelve week period and a final destructive growth analysis was performed between 125 and 140 days. Elevated [CO₂] and/or elevated temperature (T° C) had little effect on tiller and leaf number, the most marked effect being an increase in final leaf length during the early stages of growth in Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina, relative to the ambient [CO₂]/ambient T° C control. Elevated [CO₂] resulted in a significant (p&lt; 0.05) decrease in leaf duration of Dactylis glomerata and Bellisperennis, but had no effect on the onset of leaf senescence in Poa alpina. The significant (p&lt; 0.05) reduction in leaf duration at elevated T° C in Poa alpina most likely reflected its alpine origins. The more rapid rate of leaf extension early in the season (Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina) and earlier onset of leaf senescence (Dactylis glomerata and Bellisperennis), suggested that elevated [CO₂] increased the rate of plant canopy development in some species. There was no clear pattern of growth response to elevated [CO₂] that could be related to functional type, with four of the eight species showing a significantly greater dry matter productivity at elevated than ambient [CO₂], two of which were slow-growing stress tolerators. A 3° C increase in temperature had little direct effect on final dry matter productivity, but when combined with an increase in [CO₂], most species showed an enhanced growth response, which was significant in three of the eight species studied.</p>
