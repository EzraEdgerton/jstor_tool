Abstract: Eight British native plant species were grown for 125 to 140 days in a suite of Solardome glasshouses set up to provide a factorial combination of two levels of CO2 (ambient/ambient + 340 ppm), two levels of temperature (ambient/ ambient + 3°C) with two replicates of each CO2 x temperature combination. Species provided two contrasting examples (a grass and forb) each of a competitor, stress tolerator, a ruderal (associated with highly disturbed environments) and mixed strategist. Treatment effects on plant canopy development were assessed at ca. weekly intervals over a twelve week period and a final destructive growth analysis was performed between 125 and 140 days. Elevated [CO2] and/or elevated temperature (T°C) had little effect on tiller and leaf number, the most marked effect being an increase in final leaf length during the early stages of growth in Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina , relative to the ambient [C02]/ambient T°C control. Elevated [CO2] resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in leaf duration of Dactylis glomerata and Bellis perennis, but had no effect on the onset of leaf senescence in Poa alpina . The significant (p&lt;0.05) reduction in leaf duration at elevated T°C in Poa alpina most likely reflected its alpine origins. The more rapid rate of leaf extension early in the season ( Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina) and earlier onset of leaf senescence ( Dactylis glomerata and Bellis perennis ), suggested that elevated [CO2] increased the rate of plant canopy development in some species. There was no clear pattern of growth response to elevated [CO2] that could be related to functional type, with four of the eight species showing a significantly greater dry matter productivity at elevated than ambient [CO2], two of which were slow-growing stress tolerators. A 3 °C increase in temperature had little direct effect on final dry matter productivity, but when combined with an increase in [CO2], most species showed an enhanced growth response, which was significant in three of the eight species studied. Introduction Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration results in an increase in photosynthesis and growth, at least in the short-term. However, the magnitude and direction of the response in the long-term (months to years) ap- pears to be species-dependent and may differ even among members of the same plant community (Bazzaz &amp; Garbutt 1988, Ferris &amp; Taylor 1993, Stirling et al. 1996, 1997). Bazzaz et al. (1995) suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CC^Jeiev) may in- tensify interplant competition and that genotypes with a greater ability to compete for resources other than CO2 will be most successful. The C-S-R plant strategy model (Grime 1974) has been used to assess the CO2 responsiveness of a wide range of British native species (Hunt et al. 1991, 1993). In this model, species are categorised into three primary strategies: com- petitors (C), stress tolerators (S) and ruderals. Com- petitive species have a high relative growth rate and are found in resource rich environments, slow-grow- ing stress tolerators are typical of resource poor en- vironments and ruderals are fast-growing species found in highly disturbed environments (e.g. grazed). In a study of 27 herbaceous species, Hunt et al. (1991, 1993) claimed that "high CCVresponsiveness was common only within the competitive strategy and its close relations". In contrast, Ferris &amp; Taylor (1993) found that two chalk grassland species classified as stress tolerators under the C-S-R theory showed sig-</page><page sequence="2">266 Stirling et al.: Plant canopy development and turnover nificant increases in shoot and root growth at [CC^Jeiev whilst a study including a range of stress-tolerant and ruderal strategists found no evidence of any loss of photosynthetic capacity after 75 to 104 days growth at [C02]eiev (Stirling et al. 1996). Short-term exposure studies are likely to overestimate the size of the growth response to [C02]eiev in the long- term, as downward adjustment or "acclimation" of photosynthesis frequently occurs and is thought to res- tore the balance between capacity for production and utilisation of photoassimilates at [CC^leiev (Stitt 1991, Webber et al. 1994). In some studies, the loss of photosynthetic capacity at the leaf level was com- pounded by a decline in leaf area with the result that total canopy photosynthesis was lower at elevated than ambient [CO2] (Oechel &amp; Reicher 1987). Significant species variation in the response of canopy develop- ment to [CC&gt;2]eiev exist (Garbutt et al. 1990, Ferris &amp; Taylor 1993, Baxter et al., 1994), with both CCVin- duced increases (Fajer et al. 1991) and decreases (Ziska &amp; Bunce 1994) in leaf area reported. Another component of canopy development is tillering or branching. Tissue (1984) reported a tillering rate in Eriophorum vaginatum grown at [C02]eiev that ap- proached six times that of plants grown ambient [CO2] ([C02]amb)- Similar increases in tillering rates in agronomic species were found by Sionit et al (1980). Species-dependent tillering responses in montane grass species to [CC^Jeiev have been described by Bax- ter et al. (1994) in which both Agrostis capillaris and Poa alpina showed increases, while Festuca vivipara showed a decrease in tiller numbers at [CC^leiev Predictors of the effect of climate change upon popula- tion growth and vegetative spread in Carex (Carlsson &amp; Callaghan 1994) suggest that both size and produc- tion of tillers will increase, followed by an earlier onset of senescence and hence decrease in tiller lifespan. Clearly, [CC^Jeiev may affect both the timing and dura- tion of canopy development, but by how much and in what direction remains unclear. Baxter et al. (1994) found an increased proportion of senescence in Fes- tuca vivipara grown at [C02]eiev » hut in Agrostis capil- laris and Poa alpina there were no such effects. According to Paez et al. (1980, 1983, 1984) annuals may attain maximum biomass, flower and complete their lifecycle sooner at [C02]eiev&gt; while Tissue (1984) reported a delayed leaf senescence in Eriophorum vaginatum at [CC^leiev- In moist, cool and temperate climates the underlying factor that determines the onset and duration of plant growth is seasonally low temperatures, but provided that other resources are not limiting, increasing temperature (especially during early growth) generally results in an increase in plant developmental rates. Morse and Bazzaz (1994) found that increasing temperature resulted in faster initial growth rates, which in turn increased the intensity and role of com- petition in determining stand size and structure. Coleman &amp; Bazzaz (1992) describe how the effects of [C02]eiev and temperature interactions on plant productivity were different than would have been ex- pected from effects of [CC^leiev alone. Most of the in- teractive effects could be interpreted in terms of the rate of leaf production and loss, nitrogen retention and to a lesser degree photosynthesis and resource par- titioning. In a study of the effects of [C02]eiev and temperature on pasture turves dominated by Lolium perennne and Trifolium repens , Clark et al (1995) found that the positive growth response of T. repens to [C02]eiev was temperature dependent, while decreas- ing L. perenne tiller density at higher temperatures was independent of [CO2]. The sixfold increase in tillering rate of Eriophorum vaginatum at [C02]eiev referred to earlier (Tissue 1984) was halved at the same [CO2] when growth temperature was increased by 4°C. Relatively little has been published on the combined effects of [C02]eiev and elevated temperature (T0Ceiev) on growth and development, but what evidence there is suggests potentially important interactions between these climatic variables on these growth processes. In an earlier paper (Stirling et al. 1997) we reported the independent and combined effects of [CC^leiev and T°Ceiev on photosynthesis of a range of native British plant species of differing functional ecology. Here, we extend this earlier study to consider effects on canopy development, turnover and dry matter productivity. Material and methods Solardome growth facility The experiment was conducted at the Solardome Climate Change Research Facility of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), Bangor, Wales, UK. En- vironmental control and monitoring have been described in detail elsewhere (Rafarei et al. 1995). The eight Solardomes were programmed to provide a fac- torial combination of two levels of CO2 (ambient/am- bient+340 ppm), two levels of temperature (ambient/ ambient+3°C) with two replicates of each CO2 x temperature combination. A detailed description of climatic conditions during the experimental period is provided by Stirling et al. (1997). Soil in each dome was excavated to a depth of 1 m and replaced with gravel. Drainage pipes were sunk into the gravel to provide pits for plant root containers and hence more realistic temperature and drainage condi-</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 267 tions than if plant containers were placed on the sur- face (Stirling et al. 1997). Plant germination and establishment The eight C3 species selected for study provided two contrasting examples (a grass and a forb) each of a competitor, stress tolerator, a ruderal and a mixed strategist (Table 1). With the exception of Poa alpina , germination and seedling establishment were carried out by the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology at Shef- field, following the rationale of the Integrated Screen- ing Programme (Grime 1974). Plants were germinated and established under controlled environment condi- tions of 22 °C day and 15 °C night and 14 h photo- period. Seedlings were raised under these conditions for 5-7 days to ensure successful establishment. Plants of Poa alpina were raised from tillers collected from grass ledges on Clogwyn y Garnedd, Y Wyddfa, Wales (Stirling et al. 1997). Tillers were grown in a glasshouse to the third or fourth leaf stage in washed silica sand and then potted on in the Solardomes as described below. Two hundred and fifty six 0.1 1 m diameter pots made from 0.5 m lengths of drainage pipe were filled with washed silica sand and placed in the sunken pits in each of the eight domes and then saturated with 1/4 strength Long Ashton solution. Established seedlings or tillers from the honeycomb cells were then trans- ferred to the prepared pots. Six individuals of each species were allocated randomly to pots within each Solardome providing a total of 12 replicate plants per species per CO2 x temperature treatment. Irrigation was applied manually three times daily during the first three weeks and twice daily thereafter. At each irriga- tion, the rooting medium was flushed with deionised water and on alternate days with Long Ashton solu- tion. Nutrient additions were gradually increased to full strength after six weeks in all species with the ex- ception of Helianthemum nummularium which re- ceived a maximum of 1/2 strength Long Ashton solution due to its slow growth. Canopy development measurements Weekly tiller and/or leaf counts were conducted on all six plants of each species, from each replicate of the four CCVtemperature treatments. For the four forb species, recording of the total number of leaves per plant commenced in June and this process was repeated weekly for twelve weeks, the data providing a cumulative record of leaf initiation with time for the duration of the experiment. For the four grass species, because total leaf and tiller counts per plant would have been too time consuming Table 1.

The main stem of four plants in each solardome was tagged with a coloured loop of cotton thread, its leaves counted and the number of daughter tillers recorded at weekly in- tervals. At the same time, one of the daughter tillers was tagged in the same manner and leaves and daughter tiller number recorded at weekly intervals. Similarly, because of the time-consuming nature of leaf extension measurements, daily recording of leaf length was restricted to the contrasting grass com- petitor {Dactylis glomerata ) and stress-tolerator ( Poa alpina). A leaf from four replicate plants per species in each solardome was tagged with a coloured loop of cotton thread after initiation, and the length measured daily using a micrometer. Measurements for indi- vidual leaves ceased when identical measurements had been recorded on three consecutive days. Senescence measurements Leaf duration was recorded for the two grass species used in the leaf extension measurements (i.e. Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina) and for a single forb species ( Bellis perennis). For each of the six plants of each species in each treatment replicate, newly in- itiated leaves of similar ontogeny were tagged with a loop of cotton thread. Daily visual assessments of their conditions were made and the date at which each leaf was assessed to have 10% of its area senescent was noted. Visual assessments then continued on a daily basis and the date at which each leaf was deemed to be 100% senescent was recorded. Growth analysis A single destructive harvest was performed between 125 and 140 days. Plant roots were washed clean of sand and together with shoots dried to a constant</page><page sequence="4">268 Stirling et al.: Plant canopy development and turnover weight in an oven for ca. 48 h. Total plant dry matter (root + shoot) was weighed and recorded for all repli- cate plants and for all eight species. Data analysis A logarithmic transformation (In) was performed on leaf extension data and a monomolecular function of the form: In Leaf length = a(l-be"ct) was fitted to data, where a is the asymptote, b is the intercept on the y-axis, c is the rate constant and t is time (d) (Hunt 1982). Data for leaf number, tiller num- ber, leaf duration and total dry matter were analysed using the 'ANOVA' procedure of the GENSTAT statistical package (Lawes Agricultural Trust, Roth- amstead, U.K.). Results Daily leaf extension data are shown for two periods corresponding to the early (June) and later (August) stages of growth of Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina (Fig. 1). The largest treatment effect was observed during the early stages of the growing season, when [CC&gt;2]eiev and elevated T°C (T°Ceiev) treatments in- creased both the rate of leaf extension and final leaf length relative to the [C02]amt/r°Camb control (Fig. la,c). Whilst final leaf length of Poa alpina was con- sistently lower in the control than all other treatments (Fig. lc,d), treatment effects on leaf extension of Dac- tylis glomerata disappeared as the season progressed (Fig. la,b). Elevated [CO2] had no significant effect on leaf production on the main stem or tillers of Dactylis glomerata and Poa alpina (Fig. 2). In contrast, at higher T°C there was an increase in leaf number on the main stem of both species (Fig. 2a, c). A more detailed statistical analysis of treatment effects on leaf and tiller development of all four grass species is shown in Table 2. In general, leaf and tiller development were not in- fluenced by [CC&gt;2]eiev, the exception being Poa annua where [CC^leiev caused a significant reduction in tiller production on the main stem (Table 2c). Similarly, leaf and tiller development of Dactylis glomerata or Fes- tuca rubra showed no response to T°Ceiev&gt; although there was evidence of a significant C02*T°C interac- tion on development of the main stem of Festuca rubra (Table lb). The effects of T°Ceiev on developmental processes of Poa annua and Poa alpina were sig- nificant but opposite, with T°CeieV resulting in an in- crease in leaf and tiller production on the main stem of Figure 1.

As treatment effects on the onset of senescence (i.e. time taken for 10% of leaf area to senesce) were similar to that for total leaf senescence, only data for the former are shown (Fig. 4). Elevated [CO2] had a significant (p&lt;0.05) effect on leaf duration of Dactylis glomerata and Bellis perennis , with the onset of senes- cence occuring ca. 9 and 1 1 days earlier, respectively at elevated than ambient [CO2]. Surprisingly, tempera- ture had no significant influence on leaf duration of these species, but caused a significant reduction in leaf duration of Poa alpina (Fig. 4). Six of the eight species studied showed an increase in total dry matter (TDM) after 125 to 140 days growth at elevated than ambient CO2, with significant CO2 ef- fects on four, Festuca rubra , Poa annua , Poa alpina and Helianthemum nummularium (Table 4).

Where significant in- teractions between CO2 and T°C occurred, these had the effect of increasing TDM above that of other treat- ments (Table 4). Discussion There have been few detailed studies of canopy development of native species at elevated C02 and T°C but the data that exist suggest a highly variable response. If studies on crop species are considered, the general consensus is for increased tillering and leaf number at [CC^leiev (Barnes et al. 1995, Batts et al. 1996, Wheeler et al. 1996). This increase in tiller production is thought to result from increased meris- tematic activity, due to the greater supply of assimi- lates at [CC&gt;2]eiev (Stitt 1991). The four grasses included in the present study, however, showed little evidence of any direct CO2 effect on either tiller or leaf production and in fact where a significant CO2- response occurred, this resulted in a decrease rather than increase in tillering (Table 2c). Whilst possible mechanisms for C02-induced increases in tillering have been suggested (Stitt 1991), it is less clear how the reverse response can occur. Nevertheless, negative effects of CO2 on tiller production of native species have been observed else were (Baxter et al. 1994). The absence of any tillering response in Poa alpina to [C02]eiev contrasts with that of an earlier study where tiller production was increased two-fold at high [CO2] (Baxter et al. 1994). This discrepancy in response may reflect differences in growth conditions and length of exposure, since plants at final harvest were only a tenth of the size of those in the present study (Baxter et al. 1994, Table 4). The present results suggest that some developmental processes, such as leaf extension, are more sensitive to [C02]eiev during the early than later part of the growing season (Fig. 1) and it may be that as plant size increases, the microclimate within the canopy becomes increasingly decoupled from the sur- rounding air. This would explain why the response of leaf extension to CO2 and T°C treatments diminished with time and why the effect was more apparent in the larger Dactylis glomerata plants than in Poa alpina (Figure 1). Where a 3°C increase in T°C had a significant effect on tiller and leaf production, this proved to be negative for Poa annua and positive for Poa alpina. In both cases, the direction of the response to T0Ceiev was un- altered by a concurrent increase in [CO2]. Differences in response to T°Ceiev cannot be explained by differen- ces in the optimum and maximum temperature for development, as these values would be expected to be lower in the species native to high altitudes (i.e. Poa alpina). Developmental processes are known to be ex- tremely sensitive to water stress (Stirling et al. 1989) and it may be that the T°C response of Poa annua reflected an indirect response to transient water deficits which may have developed during the warm summer months at T°CeieV. If this was the case it sug- gests that tiller and leaf production of Poa annua were more susceptible to water stress than in the stress- tolerator, Poa alpina. As was the case in the grasses, [C02]eiev had little ef- fect on total leaf production of the four forb species (Fig. 3, Table 3). In addition, a significant T°Ceiev ef- fect was found only for Helianthemum nummularium , and only in combination with an increase [CO2] for Plantago lanceolata. Comparative data for leaf production in native forb species are difficult to find, but the results contrast with those for crop species, such as winter wheat, where a doubling of [CO2] resulted in a substantial increase in both tiller and leaf number (Batts et al. 1996). However, since crops have been bred for maximum productivity with a high leaf area and sink capacity, it may be that developmental processes of crop species are inherently better able to respond to [CC^leiev than in native plant species. Another, and perhaps more likely, possibility is that the magnitude of the [C02]eiev effect on developmental rates of native species is too small to be detected by weekly, or less frequent, measurements. If [CC^eiev increased leaf development by a few days (for ex- ample), it would be extremely difficult to detect given the high variability amongst plants and the lifespan of individual leaves. Whilst a similar number of leaves may be detected at ambient and elevated [CO2], leaves in the latter treatment may be one or two days older. Indeed, a more detailed study in controlled environ- ment growth cabinets has shown that leaf initiation in Dactylis glomerata occurs ca. 2 days earlier at elevated than ambient [C02] (Harmens, Stirling, Marshall &amp; Farrar, unpublished data). Consistent with the view that [C02]eiev accelerates development is the observa- tion of earlier flowering in crop and native species (Paez et al. 1983, Wooding et al. 1992) and earlier leaf senescence (St Omer &amp; Horvath 1983). The present results indeed also show a decrease in leaf duration of both Dactylis glomerata and Bellis perennis at [C02]eiev In contrast, and in agreement with Baxter et al. (1994), there was no evidence of any decrease in leaf duration of Poa alpina at [CC^leiev and it is likely that the greater sensitivity of this species to T°Ceiev reflected its alpine origins. In this medium- term study, only half of the species studied showed a significant increase in growth at [C02]eiev, including three grasses and one forb (Table</page><page sequence="9">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 273 4). Furthermore, there was no direct relationship be- tween C-S-R strategy and CCVresponsiveness, as reported in earlier short-term studies (Hunt et al. 1991, 1993). Indeed, positive CO2 responses occurred in species across the range of functional types, including the two stress-tolerators, Poa alpina and Helian- themumnummularium. It has been suggested that most native species, irrespective of functional strategy, are capable of responding to [CC^eiev at some stage in their lifecycle and that short-term studies may be in- herently biased towards faster growing competitive strategies (Stirling et al. 1996). In the long-term, the initial stimulation of growth at [CC^leiev may result in dilution of tissue nutrient concentrations and downward adjustment of photosynthetic capacity, with the result that the initial advantage of fast-grow- ing competitors at high [CO2] may be lost over time (Stirling et al. 1996). A 3°C increase in T°C had little direct effect on final dry matter productivity, but when combined with an increase in [CO2] most species showed an enhanced growth response, which was sig- nificant in three of the eight species studied. In conclusion, the results indicate that the effects of [C02]eiev and/or T°C on developmental processes such as tillering and leaf production were rather moderate and that the most marked effect is likely to be an in- crease in individual leaf size, without a significant change in numbers. However, there was some indica- tion of a more rapid rate of development at [C02]eiev both in terms of the rate of leaf extension and early onset of senescence. There was no clear pattern of growth response to [C02]eiev that could be related to functional type and it appears that most species are capable of responding to [C02]eiev&gt; the size of the response being highly dependent on duration of ex- posure and availability of other growth resources. Finally, [CC^leiev and T°Ceiev were shown to interact to affect development and growth in a manner that could not be predicted from their independent effects. In view of these results, and the fact that both variables are predicted to increase in concert (Houghton et al. 1994), studies aimed at understanding plant and ecosystem responses to climate change need to take into account the effects of both elevated [CO2] and T°C.
