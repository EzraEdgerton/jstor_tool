Abstract: Net CO2 assimilation (A), transpiration (E) and water use efficiency (WUE) were compared in two C3 grasses and two C3 dicot herbs of a xeric temperate loess steppe after exposure in open top chambers for 1, 2, 11 and 36 months to present (350 ļimol mol"1, LC O2) and elevated (700 (imol mol"1, HC O2) levels of CO2. Acclimation of A to elevated CO2 varied both between species and over the course of the period of exposure. In the first month of exposure photosynthesis of Festuca rupicola grown at elevated CO2 concentration showed a significant upward regulation. Salvia nemorosa did not show acclimation of photosynthesis after the first month of exposure. After the 2nd month of exposure, F. rupicola maintained its upward acclimation. S. nemorosa also showed upward acclimation of net photosynthesis both in the initial slope and the plateau of the CO2 assimilation vs intercellular CO2 concentration (A/ci) curve. After 1 1 months of exposure, the grasses displayed a downward acclimation in the decreased initial slope of the AJa response curve and similar A at high CO2 concentrations in plants grown at high CO2 concentartion (HC O2 plants). Transpiration decreased with an increase of Ci in the grass species, while in the dicot species it was not affected by any change in Ci. Long term exposure to high CO2 causes a similar acclimation of stomatal regulation and transpiration to that of photosynthesis. Instantaneous WUE significantly increased in all species grown at elevated CO2. After 36 months of exposure the monocot species showed a downward acclimation in Rubisco capacity and its A/ci curve did not reach saturation. The dicot species showed upregulation regarding either the Rubisco capacity or Pi/RuBP regeneration capacity. In the short term, monocot species are more responsive than the dicot ones. Further, acclimation of photosynthesis in Pi/RuBP regeneration capacity is an earlier response than that of Rubisco activity/amount. In the long term, HC O2 treatment caused alleviation of the Pi regeneration limitation at high CO2 concentrations, while in LC O2 plants the A/ci curve showed saturation in all of the species. Species responded at different time scales and in different ways to exposure to HCO2 treatments. The grass species responded earlier and maintained their response characteristics after the first month of exposure, while the dicot species responded later and their response characteristics changed with the advance of exposure to HCO2 treatment. These differences can partly be attributed to probable sink limitation in the monocot species, which was apparently absent or smaller in the dicots.

An "up- ward regulation" of photosynthesis yields an increase of netCC&gt;2 assimilation (Arp &amp; Drake 1991, Campbell et al. 1988). In the opposite, "downward regulation" of photosynthesis results in a decreased level of net CO2 assimilation (Jarvis 1993, Ceulemans &amp; Mousseau 1994). Several attempts have been made to explain the downward regulation of photosynthesis in response to elevated CO2. Starch, as an end-product imposes a negative feedback on photosynthesis, when sucrose- levels exceed sink demand (Azcon-Bieto 1983). The widely observed decrease in Rubisco capacity also contributes to the downward regulation (Sage et al. 1989, Jacob et al. 1995). Pi-regeneration capacity in- creases relative to RuBP regeneration capacity during acclimation to elevated C02 (Sage et al. 1989). Decreased proteiņ-nitrogen content is a frequent symptom in plants grown at elevated CO2 concentra- tion (see Jarvis 1993, Grodzinski et al. 1995). The higher CO2 concentration gradient between the am- bient atmosphere and leaf intercellular spaces enables plants to keep stomatal aperture small (Rogers et al. 1983), by this means plants minimize transpiration (Kimball &amp; Idso 1983). As a consequence, one of the most often reported benefits of elevated C02-levels is increased water use efficiency (Rogers et al. 1983, Morison &amp; Gifford 1984). Very little is known about the long-term responses of natural vegetation including herbaceous species (eg. Tissue &amp; Oechel 1987, Curtis et al. 1989, Ziska et al. 1 990, Newton 1 99 1 ) to elevated atmospheric C02 con- centrations; few experiments have been run for more than two seasons (see Körner &amp; Miglietta 1994). Data on herbaceous perennials from temperate continental grasslands are particularly scanty. In this paper we present the net CO2 assimilation^ transpiration and WUE responses to 700 ļimol mol" CO2 concentration in perennial C3 species from a xeric temperate loess grassland after a 1, 2, 11, and 36 months of exposure. Differences between photosyn- thesis acclimation types and between acclimation characteristics of species were investigated also con- sidering the significance of the duration of exposure. Materials and methods The studied vegetation is a xeric temperate loess steppe (Salvio-Festucetum rupicolae pannonicum) (Zólyomi &amp; Fekete 1994) situated at the border of the Hungarian Great Plain at 160 m altitude a.s.l. The parent rock is sandy loess and loess with thick humus- and nutrient-rich A horizon. The original grassland is made up of more than 90 species. The CO2 fumigation experiment was carried out in the Botanical Garden of the Agricultural University at Gödöllo in open top chambers (Tuba et al. 1994, 1995). The climate is temperate continental with hot dry summers; mean an- nual precipitation 500 mm or less; annual mean temperature of 11 °C; and large annual amplitude of temperature changes (22 °C). Monoliths (size: 50x50x30 cm (depth)) were removed from the grassland and transplanted into the open top chambers (size: 1 .28 m diameter) with four monoliths in one chamber. The soil in the chambers was removed and it was replaced by soil from the profiles where the monoliths had been collected from. Four weeks after the transplantation of the monoliths the grass was cut. Following a two-month adaptation period, the mono- liths were exposed gradually, over a 4 weeks period, to 700 jimol mol"1 C02. The air CO2 concentrations in the elevated and present-day C02 chambers were maintained as described elsewhere (Tuba et al. 1995). Open top chamber plots were irrigated by a sprinkler irrigation system in both the HC O2 and LC O2 treat- ments. First measurements of A/q curves (see below) in the leaves of the investigated species have been made after one month of exposure to 700 (imol mol"1 ( HCO2 treatment) and the present CO2 treatments at 350 ļimol mol"1 (LC O2 treatment). Second, third and fourth series of measurements were made after 2, 1 1 and 36 months of the beginning of exposition. Five randomly selected replicates were taken from the treat- ments for these gas exchange measurements at each occasion. The rates of light saturated net CO2 assimilation (PAR: 1200 ļumol m"2 s"1 , leaf temperature 23 ±1 .5 °C leaf temperature) were measured using an LCA2-type IRGA system (ADC Co. Ltd., Hoddesdon, U.K.), operated in differential mode and Parkinson LC-N and LC-B leaf chambers, as previously described (Tuba et al. 1995). Intercellular CO2 dependence of light saturated net CO2 assimilation rates (A/q curves) was measured using the same system (Tuba et al. 1995). Ambient CO2 concentrations of 100, 350, 500, 700 and 1000 ļLimol mol"1 were produced by a gas diluter (GD 600, ADC Co. Ltd., Hoddesdon, U.K.). Measurements were carried out in the morning hours. Prior to measurements leaves were acclimated to the ex- perimental conditions for at least 20 min. Gas-ex- change parameters (A, q) were calculated according to von Caemmerer &amp; Farquhar (1981). Transpiration rate was also measured by the LCA2. Water use efficiency</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1997) 299 of photosynthesis (WUE) is given as the ratio of net CO2 assimilation rate to transpiration rate. Leaf areas were measured by a leaf area meter (LAM 001, Delta T Devices, Cambridge, U.K.). The Mitscherlich func- tion (Thornley &amp; Johnson 1990) was used to fit curves to the data on A/C]. Statistical analyses (Student-t, homogeneity of regression coefficients of the initial slopes of the A/c¡ curves) were carried out using the GB-STAT software (Friedman 1988). The species studied during the 3 years exposure to 700 |nmol mol"1 and 350 jLimol.mol"1 CO2 concentration were Festuca rupicola Heuff., Dactylis glome rata L., Filipendula vulgaris Mönch, and Salvia nemorosa L. F. rupicola , the dominant species of the grassland, has sclerenchymatous erect leaves of waxy surface, while the others are frequent characteristic species of the grassland with different leaf characteristics: Dactylis has flat blades; Filipendula has soft, large incised leaves; and Salvia has broad, entirely waxy, abaxially hairy rosette and stem-leaves. All species are perennial and have C3 photosynthesis. Results Net photosynthesis, transpiration and WUE responses after 1 month of exposure Net CO2 assimilation did not differ significantly bet- ween HC O2 and LCO2 F. rupicola plants when measured at 350 jumol mol"1 external CO2 concentra- tion, but A was significantly higher in HCOi plants than in LC O2 ones when measured at 700 ļimol mol" external C02 concentration (Fig. 1).

Net photosynthesis responses as derived from A/a curves after 2 months of exposure Initial slope of the A/c¡ curve was similar in HC O2 and LCO2 F. rupicola leaves, while at the highest q, HCO2 plants had significantly higher A (P&lt;5%) than LCO2 ones (Fig.3), indicating upward acclimation of A. In the dicot species F. vulgaris and S. nemorosa , initial slopes of the A/c¡ curves and A rates at high CO2 con- centrations were higher in the HC O2 plants than in the LCO2 ones (Figs 4-5). Upward acclimation showed up in all HCO2 plants, the degree of which was greater in the dicot species. This acclimation was verified by the significantly higher A-s at high q values of the A/q response curve, while the initial slopes of these curves proved to be less reliable indicators of acclimation.

At high q's HCO2 plants of these dicot species showed higher A than LC O2 ones (Table 1), reflecting an upward acclimation of A to 1 1 months exposure to elevated CO2.</page><page sequence="6">302 Nagy et al: Acclimation of plants to elevated CO2 Figure 6. A/ci response curve in the leaves of F. rupicola (A) and F. vul- garis (B) grown at present (350 ļimol mol" ) and elevated (700 ļimol mol"1) CO2 concentration after 36 months of exposure. Transpiration rates as measured either at 350 and 700 ļumol mol"1 external C02 concentration were lower in the leaves of HC O2 plants of F. rupicola and D. glomerata than in the leaves of LCO2 plants (Table 2). There were no differences in E between HC O2 and LC 02 plants of the dicot F. vulgaris and S. nemorosa (Table 2) at any external CO2 concentration. WUE was higher in the leaves of HC O2 plants than in those of LC O2 ones in all species, and the increase of WUE was larger in the dicot species (Table 2). Gas exchange responses after 36 months of exposure In the leaves of the monocot F. rupicola neither the in- itial slopes of the A/c¡ curves, nor the A values at high CO2 concentrations were different between the HC O2 and LCO2 plants (Fig. 6.A). In the leaves of the dicot F. vulgaris upward acclimation of A was maintained in both of these parameters (Fig. 6.B). Discussion Acclimation of photosynthesis due to elevated C02 oc- curred in different time scales and in different ways in the investigated monocot and dicot species. The monocot F. rupicola responded to 1 month elevated CO2 with unchanged Rubisco capacity and with a slight increase in P¡ regeneration capacity - as concluded from A/q responses - and maintained this type of response after two months of exposure, also. Upward acclimation was therefore due to an increase in Pj regeneration capacity (Sage et al. 1989), while ac- climation was absent regarding the capacity of Rubis- co (Caemmerer &amp; Farquhar 1984, Sage et al. 1989).</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 303 However, after 1 1 months of exposure the type of the acclimation has been changed and the monocot species showed a downward acclimation of net photosyn- thesis, reflected in a decreased Rubisco capacity as compared to that in the plants grown at present CO2 concentrations. From these responses, changes in the Pi regeneration capacity (Arp &amp; Drake 1991, Campbell et al. 1988) seem to be an earlier indicator of acclimation than that by Rubisco capacity, at least in the grass species. Continued exposure to elevated CO2 until the 36th month changed this latter response characteristic only slightly; the degree of downward acclimation was decreased after 3 years. D. g lome rata, the other investigated monocot has also shown downward acclimation of net photosynthesis with similar changes in Rubisco capacity and in P¡ regenera- tion as described for F. rupicola. This time course of acclimation is consistent with the model, that car- bohydrate sink limitation occurs first and is followed by the decrease in Rubisco capacity (Jacob et al. 1995, Vanoosten &amp; Besford 1996). This view is also sup- ported by studies, providing evidence for a balance between the rate of carbohydrate supply and utilization capacity of the sink (Barrett &amp; Gifford 1995). Further, increased N-supply may alleviate the downward ac- climation of photosynthesis (Bowler &amp; Press 1996), through maintenance of leaf N-content (Rogers et al. 1996). The dicot S. nemorosa and F. vulgaris did not give sig- nificant response after one month of exposure to high CO2, while after two months these species showed a slight upward acclimation, the degree of which in- creased after 1 1 months, and was maintained there- after. Upward acclimation was manifested in small differences in the initial slopes of the A/c¡ curves and by the fact that the HC 02 plants did not show satura- tion of the A/c¡ response curve. Starch accumulation in the leaves under high CO2 was observed in the investigated monocot species but not in the two dicot ones in a parallel study (Tuba et al. 1995). Sink limitation can therefore be a candidate for the observed downward response by the monocots. The larger root system of the dicots than that of the monocots may lie behind the delayed response of the dicot species (no acclimation response after 1 month) to high CO2, too. At the same time the downward ac- climation of the monocots was associated also with a decreased initial slope of the A/q curves and a decreased leaf protein N content (Tuba et al. 1995). However, this response showing downward acclima- tion must be probably due to decreased Rubisco amount that occurs only after a long term (11 month) exposure to high C02. High CO2 concentration may therefore increase al- location to the roots at first, where species morphology is plastic enough to allow this change to be significant. This, in turn would accomodate the higher load of as- similates from the leaves even for an extended period (i.e. years). The resulting larger root system may or may not satisfy the N-demand by the shoots, either due to the larger allocation of N to the roots, or due to the inadequate supply of available N from the soil. This may be the reason why the apparent N-shortage shows up later on than the limitation by the sink capacity. In other words, increase in sink capacity would be the first response, which, however would have its cost in the decreased shoot-N level with negative consequen- ces on CO2 assimilation by the leaves. The new steady- state of acclimated net C02 uptake seems to stabilize in perennial herbaceous species of the loess grassland with the advantage for the dicot species or for species which are plastic enough in their root-shoot partition- ing to accomodate the higher assimilate loading from the shoots, while ensuring N requirement by the shoots. Gas exchange acclimation responses are influenced by the length of exposure to high CO2 (Makino 1994). Upward acclimation is reported for exposure period as long as 8 years (Jacob et al. 1995). Downward ac- climation is less probable to occur if sufficient sink strength is available (Wang &amp; Nobel 1996). Sig- nificance of the duration of exposure period to high CO2 is shown by the changing acclimation of the in- vestigated species over an extended period. Despite the downward acclimation in A, the monocot species showed a higher WUE when grown at high C02 concentration due to their decreased transpiration rates. Increase in WUE as a response to elevated CO2 is well documented (Amthor 1995, Beerling &amp; Wood- ward 1995, Pearson &amp; Brooks 1995, Santrucek &amp; Sage 1996). However, this increase was found to be smaller in grasses than that in herbs at high (700 (imol mol" ) CO2 concentration (Beerling &amp; Woodward, 1995). Higher WUE in the dicot species was rather due to their increased A than due to a decrease in E, since transpiration rates were nearly the same in HC O2 and LCO2 plants.
