Abstract: Using open-top chambers, four prominent species of Irish neutral grasslands, Lolium perenne, Cynosurus cristatus , Holcus lanatus and Agrostis capillaris were grown at ambient and elevated (700 jimol mol"1) atmospheric CO2. The effects of intra- and interspecific competition on plant responses to CO2 enrichment was investigated by growing the species in monocultures at two densities and in a four-species mixture. The results indicate that the species differ in their ability to respond to elevated CO2. In the monocultures, L. perenne , H. lanatus and A. capillaris responded positively to elevated CO2, with an increase in harvestable biomass, but C. cristatus did not respond to CO2 enrichment. The CO2 stimulation of biomass production for L. perenne , H. lanatus and A. capillaris was accompanied by increased tillering. In addition, reductions in the specific leaf area for L perenne and H. lanatus were observed. The results show that species vary in their response to elevated CO2. As a result, species composition in natural plant communities is likely to change at elevated CO2.

Introduction The majority of the experimental evidence indicates that the growth of C3 plants is stimulated by CO2 en- richment. However, results of these experiments indi- cate that there is a large variability among species in the amount of response. Growth of C4 plants can also be enhanced by elevated atmospheric CO2, but the magnitude of response is generally less than that ob- served with C3 species. In a compilation of literature sources, Poorter (1993) reported a 37% average stimulation in the growth of 156 species with a doubl- ing of the ambient CO2 concentration. The growth en- hancement was larger for C3 species (41 %) than for C4 plants (22%), with CAM species being less stimulated in growth (15%) than the average C4 species. Hunt et al. (1991, 1993) screened a wide range of herbaceous species to determine the responsiveness of plant growth to elevated CO2. The results indicated that the CC&gt;2-responsiveness of plants was closely related to functional type (Grime 1977). Based on a simple em- pirical model, Huntetal. (1991, 1993) predicted a high CC&gt;2-responsiveness for species found in productive, undisturbed habitats, the competitive functional type (C), with increases in total biomass ranging from 27- 30%. Those species adapted to conditions of high en- vironmental stress (S) or high physical disturbance (R) showed a smaller response, with increases only in the order of 6-11%. The differential species responses to elevated CO2 may result in an alteration of the com- petitive relationships and community species com- position, an aspect that has been receiving greater attention in CCVenrichment research during the past few years. Elevated CO2 may have profound indirect effects on plant-plant interactions by intensifying competition for light, water and nutrients (Bazzaz &amp; McCon- naughay 1992). However, there are few data in the literature on the effect of intraspecific competition on plant growth responses to elevated CO2. For Lolium perenne grown at five different densities, Schenk et al.</page><page sequence="2">250 Jongen &amp; Jones: Elevated CO2 in a grassland (1995) concluded that intraspecific competition strongly modified the response to CO2 enrichment. While aboveground biomass of L. perenne increased on average by 17% independent of plant density at elevated CO2, belowground biomass changed by be- tween -4% and +107% due to an interaction with plant density (Schenk et al. 1995). A recurrent theme in recent literature is the effect of elevated CO2 on competition between species with contrasting characteristics, i.e. with different function- al types, such as C3 versus C4 species or grasses versus legumes. These studies tend to show that elevated CO2 confers a competitive advantage to one functional type over the other. In plant communities dominated by legumes and C3 grasses, exposure to elevated CO2 has been shown to alter the species composition in favour of the legume (Hardacre, Laing &amp; Christeller 1986; Newton et al. 1994; Clark et al. 1995). Several studies have shown that with CO2 enrichment, C3 species may ultimately enjoy greater dominance over C4 species (Bazzaz &amp; Carlson, 1984; Patterson, Flint &amp; Beyers 1984; Arp et al. 1993). However, little is known on the likely effects of elevated CO2 on competition between grasses in temperate grasslands where C4 plants are rare. The commonly occurring lowland grassland vegeta- tion types in Ireland have been described by O' Sul- livan (1965, 1982), with grasslands belonging to the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class, associations Centau- reo-Cynosuretum and Lolio-Cynosuretum comprising the majority of Irish permanent pastures (O' Sullivan 1965, 1982). In the province of Leinster, covering much of the east of Ireland, neutral grasslands, in par- ticular stands of the association Lolio-Cynosuretum, are prevalent and include the majority of leys or tem- porary grasslands (O' Sullivan, pers. comm.). These are intensively managed pastures on highly fertile soils, generally species-poor and almost invariably dominated by Lolium spp. and Trifolium repens. Rod- well (1992) defined the Lolio-Cynosuretum as a short, tight sward which is grass-dominated. In this study the CO2 responsiveness of four prominent species of neutral grasslands grown in mono- or mixed cultures at two densities was assessed. Material and methods Open-top chambers ( OTC) and CO2 control system Six open-top chambers (OTC), based on the design described by Ashenden et al. (1992), were used for the experiment. There were several modifications made to the basic design. Each chamber was cylindrical in shape with a diameter of 1.7 m and a height of 1.3 m. The chamber framework was made from flat, gal- vanised mild steel, 25 mm wide and 3 mm thick. Sheets of 2 mm thick, clear UV-stabilised acrylic sheeting were bolted to the outside of the framework. A 25 cm wide frustrum was fitted tightly to the top of the chamber. The OTC were arranged in pairs supplied by air from a single fan unit. The fans (Ventac &amp; Co Ltd., Dublin) operated at 6 m3 min"1. Air was ducted from the fans to the chambers by 180 mm diameter flexible ducting, and then, after a flow splitter, by 120 mm diameter flexible ducting. The CO2 was injected into the air flow 2 m before reaching the chamber inlet. Inside the chambers, the air was distributed around the circumference at ground level by a 20 cm diameter 'Lay-Flat' polythene tube (Bailey Polythene, Ventnor, Isle of Wight). The tubing was perforated by holes, 1 cm in diameter, either 5 or 10 cm apart in two parallel rows which were 8 cm apart vertically along its length. The more frequent perforations were placed on the upper side of the tubing to direct the emerging air towards the centre of the OTC, rather than having the greatest flow down towards the ground. The atmosphere within three of the chambers was maintained at elevated CO2 concentrations with a set value of 700 ļimol mol"1 and the other three were at ambient concentrations of CO2 (approximately 354 ļimol mol"1). The CO2 supply to the elevated chambers was regulated by computerised mass flow controllers. The CO2 control system consisted of a computer linked to a sampling IRGA (PP Systems, Hitchin, Herts, UK) which regulated the mass flow controllers (Unit Instruments, Dublin, Ireland). The effectiveness of control was dependent on wind conditions with best control being achieved in calm weather. Tested con- tinuously over the period 2nd to 19th August 1994, the measured CO2 concentration at 50 cm above ground level in the middle of the chamber averaged (±sdi 695.9±43.9, 695.2±41.0 and 699.4±46.9 Mmol mol"1 for the individual chambers. Plant material and growth conditions The experiment was established in 1994 at the Trinity College Botanic Gardens, Dublin, 53° 8' N, 6° 23' W. Based on the studies of O'Sullivan (1965, 1982) the following four species were selected for use in the ex- periment: Lolium perenne L., Cynosurus cristatus L., Holcus lanatus L. and Agrostis capillaris L. Seeds, ob- tained from Dardis &amp; Dunns Seeds Ltd. (Ashbourne, Ireland) were germinated in vermiculite. Within 14 days of germination the seedlings were transplanted singly into a 5 x 5 cm seed tray filled with soil, and subsequently kept in the glasshouse for up to 20 days. On the 1st of July 1994 the plants were transplanted</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 25 1 into pots located in the OTC, and the CO2 treatment commenced. There were three planting treatments for each ex- perimental species: (I) monoculture low density (ML), 65 plants m"2; (II) monoculture high density (MH), 455 plants m"2; (III) four-species mixture (Mx) with a density of 451 plants m~2. In the monocultures, pots of 14 cm diameter were used. They were planted with 1 plant for ML and 7 plants for MH. Pots of 49 cm diameter, planted with 85 plants, were used for Mx. In the four-species mixture, the species were planted in a 1:1:1:1 ratio in a hexagonal design to give an equal minimum between-plant spacing of 5 cm. Each plant was surrounded by 2 individuals of the associated species, e.g. H. lanatus was surrounded by 2 L. perenne , 2 C. cristatus and 2 A. capillaris. There were six replicate pots per treatment, two in each of the open- top chambers. All pots were 40 cm in depth and filled with soil collected from a neutral grassland site. After stripping an area of turf in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, soil was taken to a depth of 20 cm. The pH values of the soil were between 7.3 and 7.6. Available P concentrations were between 2 and 3 jug g"1, nitrate- N between 6 and 14 'ig g"1, K between 160 and 186 |Hg g"1 and Mg between 140 and 255 (Ig g1 (Byrne, pers. comm.). These samples were taken prior to fertiliza- tion. P fertilizer was applied at a rate of 90 kg ha"1 as superphosphate, N fertilizer was applied at a rate of 120 kg ha"1 as calcium ammonium nitrate. Both were thoroughly mixed with the soil at potting. All pots were watered when necessary to maintain them close to field capacity. Plant measurements The plants were harvested three times between July and September 1994. The first harvest was made 25 days after transplanting (DAT), on the 26th of July, followed by a harvest in August (50 DAT) and Sep- tember (80 DAT). The plants were harvested by clip- ping to a height of 5 cm above soil level. Surface area of a subsample of freshly cut leaves was measured using a leaf area meter (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Only youngest fully expanded leaves were sampled for determination of specific leaf area. Plant material was then dried for 48 h at 80 °C for dry weight determination. The number of tillers per plant was recorded at the first harvest only. Statistical analysis The data for biomass, tiller count and specific leaf area were each subjected to a four- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a split-plot design with CO2 as the main plot and species, date and block as subplots. CO2, species and date were treated as fixed effects and block was considered a random effect. The model included CO2, species, date, block, the two-way interactions between CO2 and species, CO2 and date, CO2 and block, species and date and the three-way interaction between CO2, species and date. Data for each planting treatment were analyzed separately. Biomass and specific leaf area were log transformed before analysis of variance. Analysis of variance was conducted using Data Desk (Data Description Inc.). Where the two- way interaction between CO2 and species was sig- nificant, the effect of CO2 on each species was determined with a Scheffé a posteriori test. Meteorological conditions Meteorological data for Merrion Square, which is 2 km from Trinity College Botanic Gardens, was obtained from the Meteorological Service, Glasnevin, Dublin. Figure 1 shows the pattern of monthly mean minimum and maximum temperatures (a) and rainfall (b) for the duration of the experiment from July until September 1994. Figure 1.

The main factor CO2 significantly (P&lt;0.05) af- fected harvestable biomass (Table 1). For the plants grown at ML and MH, the overall effect of CO2 enrich- ment was an increased biomass of 45% and 58%, re- spectively. At ML an average harvestable biomass of 3.54 g plant"1 was recorded at elevated CO2, with 2.43 g plant"1 at ambient CO2. At MH, the average biomass per plant was greatly reduced with 1.04 g plant"1 at elevated CO2 and 0.66 g plant"1 at ambient conditions. For the four-species mixture, exposure to elevated CO? increased the biomass from an average of 0.48 g plant" to 0.58 g plant"1, representing a 21% increase. The main factor species was significant (PcO.OOl) for all planting treatments (Table 1). Of the four species, H. lanatus had the highest harvestable biomass per plant at all planting treatments, ranging from an average of 1.1 g plant"1 at Mx to 5.8 g plant"1 at ML. L. perenne biomass was approximately half that of H. lanatus ir- respective of planting treatment. Harvestable biomass of C. cristatus and A. capillañs was small compared to L. perenne and H. lanatus. The main factor date also had a significant (P&lt;0.001) effect on harvestable biomass, which is probably attributable to (a) the es- tablishment of the plants and (b) seasonal changes in growth conditions i.e. day length and temperature (Fig. 2). At ML and MH, species responded differentially to CO2, as indicated by the significant (P&lt;0.05) two-way interaction between CO2 and species (Table 1). Scheffé a posteriori tests indicated that CO2 had a sig- nificant effect on the biomass of H. lanatus at ML and MH, L. perenne at MH and A. capillañs at ML, with in all cases an increase in harvestable biomass at elevated CO2. Biomass of C. cristatus was not affected by exposure to elevated CO2 at any of the planting treatments (Table 1). Average percentage biomass response to CO2 enrichment (biomass at elevated C02/biomass at ambient CO2) differed between Figure 2.

The greatest relative increase in har- vestable biomass with CO2 enrichment was found for H. lanatus at all three planting treatments. This response was most pronounced for the plants grown at MH (78.3%, P=0.002, Scheffé a posteriori test). The 55.7% biomass increase at high CO2 at ML for H. lanatus was significant at P&lt; 0.05 (Scheffé a posteriori test). Large stimulations in biomass were also found for L. perenne at ML and MH. The 62.7% increase at MH for L perenne was significant at P&lt;0.001 (Table I, Scheffé a posteriori test), while the 27.8% increase at ML was not significant. For A. capillaris , substantial relative increases in biomass at high CO2 were only found in the monocultures, with values of 105.4% (PcO.OOl, Scheffé a posteriori test) and 27.6% at ML and MH, respectively. However, elevated CO2 had lit- tle effect on harvestable biomass of C. cristatus. The effect of CO2 on biomass production of this species ranged from -4.2% at ML to 11.8% at Mx. For all species at all planting treatments, C. cristatus grown at ML was the only case where there was a negative response to an increase in the atmospheric CO2 con- centration. Species varied in their performance over time, as reflected by the significant (PcO.OOl) two- way interaction between species and date on biomass in all planting treatments (Table 1). No significant in- teraction between CO2 and date was found for biomass. Tillering As a main factor, CO2 had no significant effect on tiller count in any of the planting treatments (Table 2). However, species as a main factor had a significant (PcO.OOl) effect on the number of tillers per plant, in- dicating that there were significant differences bet- ween species. The highest tiller count was found in L perenne in all planting treatments, with 25 tillers plant'1 at MH and Mx and 39 tillers plant"1 at ML (Fig. 4). C. cristatus had the lowest tiller count in all plant- ing treatments, with average values of 16 at ML, 1 1 at MH and 7 at Mx. Tiller counts per plant for H. lanatus at 32, 17 and 23 for ML, MH and Mx respectively, were higher than those for A. capillaris (17, 14 and 7 for ML, MH and Mx) in all planting treatments. The two-way interaction between CO2 and species was found to be significant for ML (Pc0.05) and Mx (PcO.Ol), indicating that the change in tiller numbers with changing CO2 is species dependent at these plant-</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 255 Figure 4.

At ML, the 153% increase in tiller count found for A. capillaris was significant at P&lt;0.05 (Scheffé a posteriori test). Increases in tiller count with elevated CO2 of 25% and 12% were found for L. perenne and H. lanatus respectively (Figure 4). A decrease in the number of tillers was found for C. cristatus at ML, with 18 tillers plant"1 at ambient CO2 and 14 tillers plant"1 at elevated CO2, representing a 22% decrease. At Mx exposure to elevated CO2 in- creased tillering of H. lanatus by 25% (PcO.Ol, Scheffé a posteriori test). A negative response to in- creasing CO2 was found for L. perenne , with an 8% decrease in the tiller count. Specific Leaf Area The main factor CO2 had no significant effect on specific leaf area in any of the planting treatments (Table 3). However, species as a main factor had a sig- nificant (PcO.OOl) effect on specific leaf area in all planting treatments. The highest specific leaf areas in all planting treatments were found for A. capillaris , while the lowest values were consistently found for L. perenne , with specific leaf area ranging from 30.9 to 37.8 m2 kg"1 at ML, 28.1 to 38.6 m2 kg"1 at MH and from 32.7 to 50.8 m2 kg*1 at Mx (Fig. 5). The main factor date had a significant (PcO.Ol ) effect on specific leaf area at ML, with an average of 32.6 m2 kg"1 in August and 34.9 m2 kg"1 in September. At Mx the specific leaf area averaged over a harvest was ap- proximately 43 m2 kg'1 in July and August, decreasing to 33.9 m2 kg"1 in September. However, no data was obtained for A. capillaris at Mx for the September har- vest, due to the very low amount of biomass present and the poor condition of the leaves. This lack of A. capillaris data in September was a major factor in the low September value of specific leaf area and probably the main cause of the significant (PcO.OOl) date effect on specific leaf area at Mx. The two-way interaction between CO2 and species was significant (P&lt;0.05) for specific leaf area at ML and MH (Table 3), indicating a CO2 effect that was depen- dent on species in the monocultures but not in the mixed culture. Scheffé a posteriori tests indicated that CO2 had a significant effect on the specific leaf area of H. lanatus at ML and MH, and L. perenne and A. capil- laris at MH, with in all cases a significant decrease in specific leaf area at elevated CO2 (Table 3, Fig. 5). The greatest percentage response in specific leaf area with CO2 enrichment was found for H. lanatus , with decreases of 16.7% (PcO.Ol, Scheffé a posteriori test) at ML and 22.4% (PcO.OOl, Scheffé a posteriori test) at MH (Table 3, Figure 5). At MH L. perenne showed a significant percentage response in specific leaf area to CO2 (-14.5%, P&lt;0.05, Scheffé a posteriori test). Elevated CO2 resulted in a 13.7% decrease in specific leaf area for A. capillaris at MH (P&lt;0.05, Scheffé a posteriori test). Although the two-way interaction bet- ween CO2 and species was not significant at Mx, decreases in specific leaf area at elevated CO2 com- pared to ambient conditions for the four species were between 3.1-12.1%. At MH the response of the specific leaf area to CO2 varied with time, as reflected in the significant (P&lt;0.05) interaction between CO2 and date (Table 3). No significant interaction between these two factors was found on the specific leaf area at ML and Mx. However, the specific leaf area at Mx in August showed a clear decrease for L. perenne , C. cris- tatus and H. lanatus as seen in Figure 5. Indeed, ANOVA on the August data alone indicated a sig- nificant CO2 effect (P&lt;0.05, results not shown). Dif- ferences between species in specific leaf area varied with time as indicated by the significant (PcO.05) two- way interaction between species and date in all plant- ing treatments (Table 3, Fig. 5). Of the four species, A. capillaris showed the most pronounced changes in specific leaf area with time, increasing between 17%</page><page sequence="8">256 Jongen &amp; Jones: Elevated CO2 in a grassland Table 3.

At Mx, specific leaf area of L perenne and C. cristatus consistently decreased with time, resulting in overall decreases between July and September of 25% for L. perenne and 30% for C. cristatus. No significant three-way interaction between CO2, species and date on specific leaf area was found at any of the planting treatments. Discussion The four grass species used in this study varied in their response to elevated CO2. When grown as monocul- tures L. perenne , H. lanatus and A. capillaris responded positively to elevated CO2, with an increase in harvestable biomass. C. cristatus on the other hand did not respond to C02 enrichment. The magnitude of CO2 response, averaged for the two monoculture planting treatments, was 50, 56 and 34% for L. perenne , H. lanatus and A. capillaris , respectively, confirming that these species differ in their ability to respond to elevated CO2. In the four species mixture, the magnitude of the CO2 response was 14, 14, 34 and 12% for L. perenne , C. cristatus , H. lanatus and A. capillaris , respectively. Previous studies have indi- cated that the CO2 response of plants not only varies between species but is sensitive to the prevailing en- vironmental and experimental conditions, resulting in a lack of consistency in reported values on CO2 stimulation of growth for individual species. Hunt et al. (1991) determined the responsiveness of plant growth to elevated CO2 for A. capillaris , H. lanatus and L. perenne , growing the plants at four CO^ con- centrations ranging from 350 to 800 (imol mol" over a 56-day period. Based on a simple empirical model, Hunt et al. (1991) predicted the % yield increase for each species with a doubling of ambient CO2 con- centration. All three species were found to respond highly to elevated CO2, with increases of whole plant dry weight of 56% for A. capillaris , 60% for H. lanatus and 34% for L. perenne. Plant growth responses to elevated CO2 were slightly higher for shoot dry weight, with values of 69% for A. capillaris , 67% for H. lanatus and 37% for L. perenne. For A. capillaris, Baxter et al. (1994) reported a doubling of total dry weight for plants grown for 79 days at 680 |Hmol mol" compared to 340 (imol mol"1 CO2. When Newbery et al. (1995) grew A. capillaris at a range of NPK treat- ments at 350 and 600 ļLimol CO2 mol"1 for 23 weeks, the average increase in whole plant dry weight, based on a single destructive harvest, over the entire range of nutrient treatments was 11%. The greatest CO2 response (17%) was found at high N, while the lowest response (5%) was found at low N. Campbell et al. (1995) studied the influence of temperature regime on the CO2 response of A. capillaris , growing plants at three temperature regimes (day/night 12/7 °C, 18/13 °C, 28/23 °C) and two CO2 treatments (350 and 700 ļimol mol"1). The CO2 stimulation of growth depended on temperature regime, with increases of 38% at 12/7 °C, 23% at 18/13 °C and 120% at 28/23 °C. There are numerous reports of the effect of elevated CO2 on L. perenne , summarized in Table 4. While there is a wide range in the magnitude of response, from -13 to 132%, the majority of studies found a growth stimulation with CO2 enrichment. Averaged over all the studies, ex- posure to elevated CO2 stimulates the growth of L. perenne by 30%. As with other species, differences in the growth response to elevated CO2 for L. perenne can be the result of differences in experimental condi- tions. In addition, Campbell et al. (1995) compared the growth of four populations of L. perenne at ambient and elevated CO2, finding significant differences in the potential to respond to C02 enrichment between the four cultivars when grown at 28 °C. Two of the cul- tivars, Vigour and Charito, showed large CO2 stimula- tions of growth, with a 110 and 130% increase in biomass respectively. A relatively small biomass response to elevated CO2 was found for the cultivar Grassland Nui (40%), with an intermediate response for Kangaroo Valley (80%). Thus, temperate varieties of this species, such as Grassland Nui appear to show relatively small responses to CO2, whereas there is a potential for a higher CO2 stimulation of growth by warm-season active populations of L. perenne from continental climates, for example Charito. In the current study, L. perenne, H. lanatus and A. capillaris showed growth responses to elevated C02 which are similar to the values reported by other authors. The response of C. cristatus to elevated CO2 reported here could not be compared with other work on this species as no relevant data were found in the literature. The lack of a CO2 stimulation of growth for C. cristatus cannot be explained in terms of life history strategy or relative growth rate (Grime et al. 1988). The CSR strategy of C. cristatus would be expected to result in a CO2 stimulation of growth, similarly the high relative growth rate of C. cristatus as reported by Grime et al. (1988) would be consistent with an ability of the plant to respond positively to high CO2 (Poorter 1993). Although, Grime et al. (1988) reported similar relative growth rates for the four species used in this experiment, unexpectedly low growth rates for C. cris- tatus and A. capillaris in comparison to L. perenne and H. lanatus were found in the current study. However, in contrast to C. cristatus , a CO2 stimulation</page><page sequence="10">258 Jongen &amp; Jones: Elevated CO2 in a grassland Table 4.

Thus the growth rates determined for each species in this ex- periment cannot be correlated with differences in the CCVresponsiveness of the species. The increase in biomass at elevated CO2 for L. perenne , H . lanatus and A. capillaris was accom- panied by increased tillering. The magnitude of CO2 response, averaged for the two monoculture planting treatments, was 18, 17, and 86% for L perenne , H. lanatus and A. capillaris respectively. Baxter et al. (1994) reported a large increase (71%) in tiller num- bers for A. capillaris at elevated CO2 after 79 days, similar to the results of the present study. For L. perenne , in another study, C02 enrichment increased the number of tillers by 31% after 148 days (Saeb0 &amp; Mortensen 1995). However, in contrast to the perfor- mance of L. perenne in the present study, Ryle et al. (1992) found no effect of high CO2 on tillering, ac- companied by a lack of an effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth. An increase in number of tillers at elevated CO2 has also been observed in other grass species (Mitchell et al. 1993; Baxter et al. 1994; Saeb0 &amp; Mortensen 1995). Nicholas et al. (1993) suggested that elevated CO2 stimulates more tillers to develop and that any biomass increase is closely related with an</page><page sequence="11">Abstracta Botanica 21 (1 997) 259 increase in the number of tillers. However, some species may exhibit reduced tillering with C02 enrich- ment. In the present study tillering of C. cristatus at ML was reduced by 22% at elevated CO2. Similarly, Baxter et al. (1994) found a significant decrease in tiller count for Festuca vivipara grown at elevated CO2, which was accompanied by a decrease in plant biomass. In the present study, significant reductions in the specific leaf area with CO2 enrichment were found for L. perenne at MH and H. lanatus at ML and MH. The changes in specific leaf area are thus largely confined to those instances where an increase in biomass was found at elevated CO2. Decreases in specific leaf area with elevated CO2 have previously been reported for L. perenne (Ryle et al. 1992) and A. capillaris (Baxter et al. 1994), and have been attributed to an altered leaf structure, with denser cell packing or an increase in non-structural carbohydrates in the leaf (Ryle &amp; Powell 1992). The reduction in specific leaf area due to the latter, probably results from an inability of the plant to invest these compounds in structural growth. For A. capillaris grown at ML, exposure to elevated CO2 resulted in a large biomass enhancement in August and September but the specific leaf area was not significantly affected. This may be the result of the large increases in tillering of this species with elevated CO2, providing these plants with additional sinks in which to invest carbohydrates. The results show that species vary in their response to elevated CO2. As a result species composition in natural plant communities is likely to change at elevated CO2.
