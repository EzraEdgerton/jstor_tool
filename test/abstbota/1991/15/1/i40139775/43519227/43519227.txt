Izsák Department of Zoology, Berzsenyi College , Szombathely Karolyi G . tér Ą.} Hungary H-9701 Keywords: coe volution, diseases, diversity, Shannon- Wiener entropy Abstract: Some mild or severe defects of individuals may influence the predator-prey coevolution and mate choice. Increasing the (polynomial) entropy of defects can serve as a special hiding mechanism. This is presumably the most effective around the middle of the reproductive life period, when the selection pressure is at its maximum. These assumptions are contrasted with some findings on the entropy maximum of human death causes. 1. Introduction In our former epidemiological investigations we noted an interesting phenomenon: a character- istic entropy maximum of (human) death causes in a certain periods of life. We suppose that this is not an artefact due to civilization, but it is also observable more generally for a number of other species. Consequently, it is worth consid- ering the problem of the possible biologial role of this entropy maximum. Since we did not find literature data concerning this question, it is necessary to identify first the biologically sub- stantial disciplines connected with this topic. In all cases, defects and diseases of different ethiology and characteristics have a general oc- currence and, in theory, a very general role in population dynamical processes. Concerning the generality of defects, Siljak (1983) states: "The normal operating mode of a large com- plex system is a failure mode. This is obviously an overstatement, but it is equally obvious that ..." Thus, the population dynamical role of de- fects and diseases arises unavoidably (Murphy 1981). We declared earlier that the complex of diseases in a population is interpretable as a system with self-contained regularities. Thus, there is presumably a certain regularity as re- gards the changes in the pattern of diseases. This can also hold for some scale parameters of this pattern. For this reason, it is expected that measuring the diversity, e.g., by the polynomial entropy (Shannon- Wiener index), we find somo regularities. In this paper, several aspects of</page><page sequence="2">38 this idea are discussed. First, it is important to emphasize that the literature is scarce and the facts are in many cases too fuzzy for a unified treatment. At the end I discuss the possibility of how to relate our earlier epidemiological find- ings to some facts mentioned in the first part of the paper. 2. Polymorphism and defense strategies with respect to inter-individual relations It is widely accepted that polymorphism has an essential role in evolution. One aspect of this in some species is the development of cer- tain evasive strategies in the evolutionary pro- cesses. The literature deals scarcely with this role of polymorphism, but there are some ex- ceptions, for example, regarding host-parasite coevolution. Here the host species develops a defensive and evasive strategy against the par- asite. Keeping the phenotypic variability at a high level, the potential host makes more diffi- cult the adaptation of the pathogen species to his organism. The main sources of this variabil- ity are allelic polymorphism, diploidy, sexual- ity and the recombination itself (Bremermann 1980, Tooby 1982). As Bremermann writes: sex and polymorphism are logistic necessities of the defensive strategies. We must of course ac- cept such a role of sexuality with some criticism (Maynard-Smith 1986). It is easy to realize that this concept has a close connection with the Red Queen hypothesis. This hypothesis interprets the role of the conspicuous individual variabil- ity as a factor which acts against the moulding of environment to become even more disadvan- tageous, being a consequence of the presence of the species itself (Van Valen 1973). We men- tion here that the host can increase the genetic diversity of the pathogen species as well. As a model to this serves the biogeographical theory of MacArthur K¿ Wilson (Jones 1982). Izsák: Hiding mechanisms and entropy maxima Presumably, similar mechanisms try to make the ability to identify certain types of individ- uals in the population more difficult. In the predator-prey situation, for example, we can also suppose the evolutional benefit of polymor- phism to be on the side of the prey. In the background of this lies the so-called apostatic foraging strategy. An example of this apostatic strategy is that predators become also specialized in colour pat- terns or in other characteristics of the prey (apo- static selection, Harvey &amp; Greenwood 1978, Levin 1982). An observation of a slightly dif- ferent nature is the effort to increase the distri- bution of eggs per patch by a moth (Thompson 1987). West (1988) published interesting data on the prey choice and diet diversity of snails. A mathematical model is also known for the situation when the success of the predator is a function of the number of preceding encounters with prey individuals (Noonburg 1982). We can presume with good reason that an evasive strategy and a hiding mechanism prevail in case of the disadvantageous or deleterious traits as well. A further manifestation of the apostatic strat- egy is that butterflies can become specialized to a special kind of flower by sucking its nectar, and the sensitivity to another kind of flower re- quires energy (Lewis 1986). Begon et al. (1986. p. 345) report on similar memory problems. It is known that all populations carry a patho- gen genetic load. Defects of different degrees and nature are natural concomitants of life. As to why disadvantageous genes are not elimi- nated from the population, there are numerous ideas (for details see Coleman 1979, Murphy 1981). Considering the apostatic foraging strategy of predators, this decreased concentration on the preys' side is a special hiding mechanism. In this case, the specialization in the prédation is harder. We can assume a similar sharing mech-</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 15(1991) anism in connection with the disadvantageous or pathological genetical traits among the cate- gories of the possible defects. In summary, there is presumably á group Sé- lection which decreases the defect concentra- tion in two senses. First, the hiding mechanism makes more even the distribution of genetic load among individuals. Second, there is a tendency to increase the manifestation categories of this load. The first kind of hiding correlates with the scalar entropy increase of the general ge- netic load; the second accompanies the increase of polynomial entropy. We deal with the latter question in the sequel. Of course, the diver- sity of defects is just partly explained by genetic diversity. Other source of this diversity is the ontogenetic diversity manifested on a fixed ge- netic basis (cf. the frialty model treated by Mantón &amp; Poss 1979, Mantón et al. 1986). Recently, there have been only scarce data referring to this problem. Individuals of some pcey species which are weaker, poorly developed or affected with defects, die with a greater prob- ability (Begon et. al. 1986, p. 445, Diamond &amp; Row 1986, .p. 339, Temple 1987). Temple assumes that there are specialcharacteristics of substandard prey individuals and the predator takes advantage of this association. On the other hand, Williams (1957) speculated of the necessity of defect distribution: w... when an or- ganism inhabits an environment similar to that in which it Has evolved, it would be not cncpected ttotft thtere wditld be ä Single or predominant tile .ofphysiological failure and death." Searching for the populątion dynapaical r qim vof the dgfect concentration we find li^Jp to tlj* mate choice mechanisms as weih Namely,' thf 4&amp;grease of t he defect concentration can serve as a special sort of masking the defects before the other sex. We think here of a mechanism similar ¿ , toapostatic selection (Halliday 1978). Unfortu- nately, we do not yet have sufficient information on the handicap of disease symptoms in mate 30 choice (cf. Pomiankowski 1989). As we know, viewpoints of the mate choice and foraging have a vast literature (Krebs &amp; Davies 1978, Begon et ài. Í986). In our investigations we often use Hurlbert's diversity indices (Izsák &amp; Juhász-Nagy 1985a, Izsák 1988, 1989 a, b). Hurl bert (1971) also refers to the links between species diversity and the searching activity for host and prey, and between diversity and mate choice. The successful searching mechanisms of the active partner have their cost, and the higher o randomization or smaller predictability of the partner's attributes affects the enhancement of that cost. This condition increases the random- ization of the number and types of defects on the side of the passive partner. 3* Entropy maximum of human death causes at the age of 25 and a possible population dynamical role We can reckon with the population dynamical role of the distribution of defects among defect types in the population. On this basis it is possible to connect some of our epidemiological observations with some population dynamical aspects. The investigations, which led to this observa- tion, concerned the changes in the diversity of death causes in the course of life. Now, diver- sity is related to the categories of death cause diagnoses (Izsák &amp; Juhász-Nagy 1985b, Izsák 1989a, b). As a general rule, we can observe a very typ- ical change in y «ars and a chąracteristic maxi- mum of this diversity. This holds true for the Shannon- Wiener entropy index as well, which is of special importance with respect, to infor- mation theory and hereby to our topics. The characteristic maximum is shown in Fig. 1. The maximum is quite sharp at the age of 25/ that is in the middle of the life interval of human</page><page sequence="4">40 Issśk: Hiding mechanisms and entropy maxima Fig. 1.

On the other hand, this maximum of entropy follows closely those years in which the probability of death is minimum, and in which we conjecture the greatest constellation of advantageous traits. We suppose, on the basis of the above, that the greater entropy of the distribution or, sim- ilarly, the smaller concentration of defects and diseases among the types of these has an adap- tive advantage. So the maximum of death cause entropy and its manifestation time may be inter- preted as maximally advantageous at the popula- tion level . The manifestation of this falls to the beginning of the reproductive years , similarly to many other advantageous traits . We stress that the assumption of this im- portant role does not mean that the entropy maximum of death causes would be necessarily a, product of evolution. It is possible that much more fundamental factors form the multitude of the rates of specific death causes, and the maximum of entropy is a simple, though very important, consequence of that. For example, the emergence of the maximum entropy is also interpretable by the shape of graphs of specific death causes. Due to their shape, the graphs exhibit departure "onwards" and "backwards" from this time interval from one another faster than t he li near rate (Izsaki: J u hász- Nagy 1984). In any case, it is also possible that behind the formation of entropy maximum there are evo- lutionary processes. In a group of animals the</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 15 (1991) 41 maximum selection pressure emerges when the age specific death rate is minimum (Hamilton 1966, Emlen 1970, Zammuto 1987). Since se- lection increases the defect entropy , the entropy of death causes presumably reaches its maximum when the selection pressure is also maximum . Another observation seems to confirm the above ideas. Survivorship parameters are in general more advantageous for females than for males. This is the indication of numerous more favourable physiological traits. On the other hand we found that the entropy of death causes is greater for females than for males through- out a considerable age interval (Izsák &amp; Juhász- Nagy 1985b). Accepting that the higher diver- sity of diseases is advantageous, we can inter- pret this fact as follows: The diversity of death causes is higher for females , where most other traits are also more advantageous for females than for males . As it stands now, all what I have said is a hypothesis only. Perhaps I have successfully drawn attention to some questions which de- serve further consideration. I consider here, for example, the the extension of our studies to different species. Also, it is hoped that we can demonstrate how diversity analyses of hu- man vital statistics may lead to remarkable and up-to-date questions in population dynamics, in genetics and even in biological reliability theory.
