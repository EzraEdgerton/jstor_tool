(Preliminary studies)* P. Csontos Department of Plant Taxonomy and Ecology, L. Eõtvõs University , Ludovika tér 2, Budapest, H-108S Hungary Keywords: germination, herb-layer, species interactions Abstract: Germination tests were carried out on herb layer species to find evidence on the role of allelopathy in affecting vegetation patterns of oakwood clearings. For selecting species pairs three hypotheses were considered: (1) surrounded individual hypothesis, (2) fastidious patches, (3) resistance hypothesis. In experiments based on (1) , Achillea distans and Solidago virga-aurea hindered significantly the growth of the roots of Poa nemoralis seedlings, which dominates on clearings. In connection with (2), Silene vulgaris a perennial herb, found to be absent from the patches of Achillea distans and Centaurea stenolepis but growing vigorously outside, was sharply restricted by the water extracts of the patchy species, both in its germination and root growth stage. In case of (3), though some significant effects emerged, the results are not sufficient to prove allelopathic exclusion of Verbascum speciosum by the dominant grasses of the clearings. With respect to the whole vegetation on oakwood clearings the following is concluded: interactions related to surrounded individuals may have a role in maintaining or increasing the diversity, and the fastidious patches have an effect on their own texture and consequently on the structure of the clearings.

Introduction In a forested area, after the removal of trees we can see remarkable textural and structural changes of the vegetation within a short time. Some species become dominant while others loose their importance. The species composi- tion and patchiness of the vegetation change as well. In the background of these changes numerous factors operate with sophisticated in- teractions and each component of the commu- nity (e.g. populations) responds differently in accordance with their tolerance (Juhasz-Nagv 1986). Allelopathy is only one of the possible effects and the following considerations make it partic- ularly interesting. Recently, this phenomenon has became not only accepted in vegetation science (Rice 1984), but is considered to have the same importance as the main abiotic fac- tors (light, temperature, moisture and mineral * This paper was presented at the 32nd I AVS Symposium, " Forests of the world: Diversity and Dynamics" , August 20-26, 1989, Uppsala, Sweden.</page><page sequence="2">26 nutrients) (Muller 1974). Nevertheless, forest communities have been relatively little investi- gated iii this regard. Lodhi (1976, 1978) studied the herb-layer pattern under the four dominat- ing tree species of a deciduous forest in Mis- souri and found the allelopathic effects of their litter responsible for the differences. Soils un- der different tree species could show consider- able differences in concentration of growth in- hibitors and the phenol spectra even if the trees are neighbouring individuals of the same com- munity (Lodhi 1975, Kuiters and Denneman 1987). More recently, the germination capac- ity of herbaceous woodland species was tested for allelopathic effects; in the presence of water extracts of the leaf litter of some dominating tree species (Kuiters 1987), and using solutions of seven phenolic compounds often occurring in litter and soil of woodlands (Kuiters 1989). In Hungary, the only work known to me is Fekete (1974) who tested the allelopathic effects of 24 oakwood species on Polygonatum odoratum. If we consider thé changes mentioned in the first paragraph as secondary succession or re- generation, there are important papers veri- fying the role of allelopathy in such processes (Muller et al. 1968, Wilson &amp; Rice 1968, Hors- ley 1977a, b, Numata 1978, Lodhi 1979, Rice 1984). Papers devoted to study allelopathy be- yond the Plant Kingdom (e.g., at the producer- -herbivore level) and papers dealing with gen- eralization of this concept or considering it as an important factor in the course of coevolution suggest that the importance of allelopathic in- teractions could easily be higher than recently known (Muller 1969, Whittaker and Feeny 1971, Barbour et al. 1980, Lovett et al. 1989). Even the soft corals (Octocorallia) produce allelo- chemicals in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Coll et al., Sammarco et al. in Lovett 1989). Turning back to plants, the oakwood clear- ings in the Visegrádi Mts. (Danube-bend, Hun- gary) offered exciting questions in species-pair Csontos: AHelopathic interactions selection. An inspiring working hypothesis, Muller's (1970, 1974) cost-benefit theory, was also interesting to test. Materials and methods Within the sessile-turkey oak zone ( Quercetum petraeae - -cerris, for phytosociological descrip- tion see Horánszky 1964) in the Visegrádi Mts., eight to ten years old clearings, with well de- veloped herb layer and shrub-sized young oaks, were considered as a stage where allelopathic effects could manifest and had already enough time to Cause detectable changes. Choice of the species pairs On the basis of the coexistence and avoidance of certain species observed in the clearings, the fol- lowing hypotheses were created to select species pairs to test allelopathic interactions. Surrounded individual hypothesis. The major- ity of species on a clearing occur in very low abundance and they can be found scattered among the mass of the dominant grasses. How could these solitary individuals defend them- selves against the bulk of grasses? Have they any allelopathic tool? (Species pairs: Solidago virga-aurea - Poa nemoralis, Calamintha clino - podium - P.n., Achillea distans - P.n., see Table 1 as well.) Fastidious (self-loving) patches. The well- known cases of finding allelopathic effects have been studied extensively (Muller et al. 1964, Chou &amp; Muller 1972, Bell &amp; Muller 1973, Rice 1984). In our case Centaurea stenolepis and Achillea distans occasionally form single-species dominant stands within the forest clearings. Their inhibitory effects were tested on species which were absent from their stands but present in the neighbouring zones. (Pairs: Centaurea stenolepis- Silene vulgaris, C.s. - Inula s altcina, Achillea distans - S.v.) Resistance hypothesis. Individuals of robust</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta, Botanica 15 (1991) Verboscum specio sum were observable along the forest paths of clearings. (Paths were formerly used for transportation of timber, but they have been abandoned.) Why does not this species occur in the depth of the clearings? Its con- siderable height, rich seed production and high constancy in natural grassland communities in the same hilly region would suggest its pres- ence there. If we suppose an allelopathic exclu- sion, disregarding now solutions based on com- petition, we must consider the two dominant grass species of the clearings. (Pairs: Brachy - podium pinnatum - Verbascum speciosum , Poa nemoralis - V.s.) Concerning the last two hypotheses I note that the questions about fastidious patches are raised for members of the same community while in the resistance case an invader stands up against a community or an assemblage of species. The allelopathic test procedure Aboveground plant materials were collected from the oakwood clearings at their flowering stage and were dried at 40 °C. Extracts were pro- duced by soaking cut parts of the dried mate- rials, equivalent to 50g fresh- weight, in 1 litre of distilled water at room temperature for 24 h. Solutions diluted with distilled water were made to contain 50 and 5% of the extracts. In each test, two replicates of 50 seeds were moist- ened with 5 and 50% extract in Petri dishes on top of or between filter papers. Controls (C) were moistened with distilled water. Below the filter papers sterilized sand was layered in half cm depth. The dishes were kept at room tem- perature in light /dark regime. After 7-11 days of incubation time the germination rates (GR) were compared using standard Chi-square tests. To evaluate the root-length data of the germi- nated seeds (RL) the Welch-test was used: A _ x-y y/SX/N + Sy/M where / is the degrees of freedom: 27 where Sy/M Sx/N + Sy/M ' because in most of the cases the standard devi- ations proved to be different in an F-test. Cases were regarded as effective in which both repli- cates were significant at the probability level of p=5% in GR and/or of p=l% in RL-tests. Results and discussion In case of surrounded individuals (experiments V, VI, VII,) Solidago and Achillea proved to be alloinhibitory on the dominant Poa nemoralis. They retarded the vegetative organ growth of the grass but did not hinder its germination. It is advantageous for them, considering that Poa mostly propagates vegetatively, but further ex- periments should be done using older Poa in- dividuals to prove that the surrounded plants indeed restrict the vegetative advance of the thick grass turfs. Production of allelochemicals seems to be beneficial for solitary species especially if they have alloinhibitory rather than autoinhibitory effects. From another point of view (cf. New- man &amp; Rovira 1975) solitary species are much more autoinhibitory explaining their solitaritv. Both may be true in some degree but it must be mentioned that we know species which produce allelochemicals in high quantity and hinder even themselves, but form patches (Curtis &amp; Cottam 1950). In case of fastidious patches (III, IV, VIII.) Silene was sharply hindered by Centaurea and Achillea both in GR and RL tests in the treat- ment with 50% extract. These results confirm the hypothesis of allelopathic exclusion, but fur- ther experiments with finer series of diluted extracts would make the results more exact.

This question could also be interesting to investigate in the species rich oak- wood clearings, because under field conditions the delay of seed germination may have the same importance as the inhibition itself, provided that appropriate competitors are present (Van Baalen et al. 1984). For the Centaurea- Inula pair no effect was detectable. Considering that both species form patches and their life histories are similar, the avoidance found in the field is caused presumably by competition. Though in our case excluded species were chosen to test it is also possible that associated species change their abundance as it was thoroughly studied in relation to Pteridium aquilinump&amp;tches (Gliess- man &amp; Muller 1978). In the experiments according to supposed re- sistance (I, II,) the results are not sufficient to prove allelopathic exclusion. However, it is con- ceivable that several species in interaction are responsible for the exclusion of the invader by creating a deleterious chemical environment in the soil (Oborny 1988). A similar concept is dis- cussed in Rabotnov's (1981) paper based on the idea of "phylocoenogenesis" of biotic systems. Considering the whole community, allelopa- thy seems to affect vegetation pattern in the clearings. Through species which behave as ex- plained by the Surrounded individual hypothe- sis, allelopathy may have a role in maintaining or increasing the diversity. Interactions among fastidious patches have considerable impact on their own texture and as a consequence of it on the structure of the clearings. Acknowledgements. I thank professor G . Fekete S.
