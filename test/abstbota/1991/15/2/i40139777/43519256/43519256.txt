Abstract: The grass species of Hungary are classified as C3 or C4 on the basis of taxonomie information. Various indices in the literature describing ecological behavior of species are used to compare these groups. C3 species dominate the grass flora; they are mainly perennials and occupy a great variety of habitats. Only 14.4% of the 174 grass species is of C4 type, which are mostly annuals on disturbed land. The few non-weedy species inhabit saline areas or calcareous grasslands. There is a temporal displacement in the phenology of grasses with different fixation pathways; the C4 species growing in the hot and dry summer period, while the C3 species have the maximal activity earlier, in May and June. The use of Ellenberg's ecological indicator values showed C4 species to occupy habitats with higher temperature than that of the habitat of C3 grasses, but no difference was found in the moisture requirements. The reported higher efficiency of nitrogen use in the C4 pathway has not resulted a preference of C4 grasses for habitats poor in nitrogen. Nomenclature: Soó, R. &amp; Kárpáti, Z.

Introduction The most extensive research on the ecological consequences of C4 photosynthesis has been made on the Gramineae. The wide geographical and ecological distribution of the family, its im- portant role in terrestrial vegetation and a remarkably high proportion of C4 species are the main reasons for the great interest. In numerous studies recent latitudinal or altitudinal distribu- tions were compared with climatic patterns. Though in most cases temperature was found to be the most important factor determining C4 grass distribution (Teeri &amp; Stowe 1976, Eh- leringer 1978, Vogel et al. 1978, Ellis et al. 1980, Batanouny et al. 1988), in others moisture was also reported to have equal or prime importance (Chazdon 1978, Hattersley 1983). Replacement of C4 grasses with their C3 counterparts with in- creasing elevation in the tropics was attributed to a combined effect of prevailing gradients of temperature, irradiance and soil moisture content (Tieszen et al. 1979, Boutton et al. 1980, Rundel 1980). Studies on small scale distributions showed habitat partitioning between coexisting C3 and C4 grasses similar to the large scale patterns (Cowl- ing 1983, Young &amp; Young 1983). This field has received only moderate attention in Europe so far, perhaps due to a poor representa- tion of C4 taxa in the native flora relative to other continents. Though we have a better understand- ing of ecological properties of vascular C4 plants in general (Doliner &amp; Jolliffe 1979, Collins &amp; Jones 1985), no study devoted specifically to gras- ses has been carried out. The aim of this survey is to compare some ecological characteristics of wild grasses with different photosynthetic pathways in Hungary. Though the area of the country is small (93,033 km2), the flora is fairly rich (more than 2100 vascular species) due to a great variety of biotopes. Under semiarid climate (Fig. 1) in the</page><page sequence="2">84 Kalapos: C3 and C4 grasses of Hungary Figure 1. Climate diagram typical of the woodland-steppe vegetation on the Great Hungarian Plain. Note the semi- arid period in summer. After Kakas (1967). Hungarian Great Plain the natural woodland- steppe vegetation is rich in grasses with a relative- ly high percentage of C4 species. Various indices describing ecological characteristics of each species were used here to compare C3 and C4 photosynthesis. Methods The classification of grass species as being either C3 or C4 was based on their taxonomie position within the family, a method used earlier by Teeri &amp; Stowe (1976). It is well established that the dis- tribution of C3 and C4 pathways in the Gramineae closely follows the subfamily division (cf. Gould &amp; Shaw 1983). All members of Pooideae, Oryzoideae and Arundinoideae have C3 pathway (with a few exceptions in the Dan- thonieae tribe), while species in Eragrostoideae and Panicoideae possess C4, with the exception of the genus Panicům, where both types are present. Where systematic information was insufficient for assessing the photosynthetic type (e.g., Panicům), the ecophysiological literature was searched through for Kranz anatomy or carbon isotope determination data for every species. Nomencla- ture follows Soó (1973). The following indices of the ecological behavior of each species were included in the analysis: Raunkiaer's life form (Soó &amp; Kárpáti 1968), na- ture conservation ranks (Simon 1988), time of flowering (Soó &amp; Kárpáti 1968) and Ellenberg's ecological indicator values (temperature (T), soil moisture content (F), soil nitrogen content (N) and soil reaction (R) preferences according to El- lenberg 1974) adjusted for the Hungarian situa- tion (Soó 1973). The nature conservation rank indices were recently developed for the Hun- garian vascular flora (Simon 1988) to characterize the role of each species in the vegetation. Categories extend from endemic, strongly protected species to cosmopolitan weeds and cul- tivated plants (for more details, see legends of Fig. 2). Except for the nature conservation ranks the cultivated species were excluded from the analysis. The frequency distributions of C3 and C4 species were compared according to each descrip- tor index. Because of the great difference in the number of species with C3 and C4 mechanism (149 and 25, respectively), relative values (per- centage of species within each group) were used for comparison. The difference between frequency distributions for the C3 and C4 species was tested using thex2 statistics for each index (Sváb 1980). Results and discussion There are 25 wild (native or adventive) grass species in Hungary with C4 pathway (Table 1), that is 14.4% of the grass flora. Considerably higher proportions were reported for regional floras at the same latitude from North America (Teeri &amp; Stowe 1976). Table 1.

While the C3 species are mainly components of natural communities (E, K, TP or TZ), most of the C4 grasses are cosmopolitan weeds (GY), and there are also some cultivated species (e.g., Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Panicům miliaceum). A similarly high proportion of ruderals was reported earlier for vascular C4 plants in Europe (Collins &amp; Jones 1985). Only few C4 grass species inhabit natural communities in Hungary (NCR= E or TZ). These can be classified as stress tolerators Figure 2.

Clas- sification follows Simon (1988). Figure 3. The distribution of Raunkiaer life forms of natural C3 and C4 grasses in Hungary. Phanerophytes (Ph), chamaephytes (Ch), hemicryptophytes (H), geo- phytes (G), hydato-helophytes (HH), hemitherophytes (TH), therophytes (Th) and cphemers (E). Classification follows Soó &amp; Kárpáti (1968). according to the C-S-R strategy concept (Grime 1979), because they live in saline areas, dry or cal- careous grasslands. A possible explanation for the lack of strong competitors among C4 grasses might be that the high light requirements of the C4 pathway can become disadvantageous under high plant densities typical of competitive situa- tions. The R (ruderal) or S (stress tolerator) strategies (Grime 1979) seem to be more success- ful for C4 plants, because these are most common in high light environments. Remarkable difference is indicated between the C3 and C4 species concerning their life form dis- tributions (Fig. 3). C3 grasses are mainly peren- nials (hemicryptophytes, geophytes), but those with C4 pathway are mostly annuals (therophytes). The opposite pattern was found in Egypt (Batanouny et al. 1988). This is quite un- derstandable if one considers the climatic dif- ferences between the two countries. While the temperate climate of Central Europe is more favorable for C3 grasses, in Egypt the C4 pathway is better adaptable than C3. As environmental conditions become less favorable for either path- way, annuals can extend their distribution further than perennials. The few perennial C4 grass species in our study ( Botriochloa ischaemum, Chrysopogon gryllus, Cleistogenes serótina and Cynodon dactylon ) are all native to Hungary. There is no perennial weed in the C4 group, though there are some ( Agropyron repens, Lolium perenne and L. multiflorum ) in the C3 one.</page><page sequence="4">86 Kalapos: C3 and C4 grasses of Hungary Figure 4. The time of flowering of C3 and C4 grass species in Hungary. The monthly mean temperatures are displayed on the top of the graph. Data from Soó &amp; Kárpáti (1968) and Kakas (1967). The difference in the time of flowering between the groups is significant (Table 2). While the C3 grasses have their peak of flowering in May and June, it occurs two months later (in July and August) for the C4 species (Fig. 4). So C4 grasses show the maximal activity during the hottest and driest part of the year (see also the climate diagram, Fig. 1), and there is little variation among species. These findings are in agreement with earlier reports on temporal displacement of the physiological activity of coexisting C3 and C4 species (Boutton et al. 1980, Ode et al. 1980, Hat- tersley 1983, Batanouny et al. 1988). The higher temperature optimum of the C4 pathway (cf. Os- mond et al. 1982) also supports this observation. Grasses with the C4 carbon fixation mechanism have higher temperature requirements than their C3 relatives as indicated by Ellenberg's tempera- ture (T) values (Fig. 5A). This is in accordance with the observed strong correlation between large scale geographical distributions and temperature (Teeri &amp; Stowe 1976, Ehleringer 1978, Vogel et al. 1978, Ellis et al. 1980, Batanouny et al. 1988) and with the higher temperature optimum of the C4 pathway (cf. Os- mond et al. 1982). It is surprising however, that the genus Cleistogenes (Eragrostoideae subf.) has a wide distribution in regions with cold winters in Southeastern Europe and Central Asia (Hartley &amp; Slater 1960). Though C4 photosynthesis has higher water use efficiency than C3 (cf. Osmond et al. 1982), no significant difference was found between the C3 and C4 groups in their moisture requirements (F value, Fig. 5B). This means that C4 species are not necessarily associated with drier habitats than C3 ones in this semiarid temperate region. A similar conclusion was drawn by Barnes et al. (1983) in a study of North American prairie com- munities. Hattersley (1983) found increasing number of C4 species along with increasing precipitation "within their preferred temperature regime" in Australia. Similar disagreement appeared between the physiological attributes and ecological behavior in the soil nitrogen requirements (N value, Fig. 5C). Though the C4 pathway is reported to have higher nitrogen use efficiency than the C3 (NUE, cf. Os- mond et al. 1982), grass species having this fixa- tion mechanism can be found in habitats with N supply somewhat higher than for their C3 rela- tives. Also, no preference for habitats of low N availability was found for C4 species in other cases (Doliner &amp; Jolliffe 1979, Collins &amp; Jones 1985). In competition experiments between C3 and C4 grasses under limited N supply, the C4 species did not have competitive superiority over the C3 ones despite their higher NUE (Christie &amp; Detling 1982, Gebauer et al. 1987). The distributions according to soil reaction (R) were less significantly different (Table 2), though only C3 species seem to tolerate the most extreme R values; the highest acidity or highest calcium content (Fig. 5D). C4 species can be frequent in saline or maritime biotopes in Europe (Collins &amp; Jones, 1985). In our analysis three grass species were typical in soils with high sodium concentra- tion ( Crypsis aculeata, Heleochloa alopecuroides and H. schoenoides), while the other natives ( Botriochloa ischaemum, Chrysopogon gryllus and Cleistogenes serótina) are components of cal- careous grasslands. Cynodon dactylon showed the broadest ecological potential being common both in salt affected and calcareous soils, and even in disturbed areas. There is a growing evidence, that C4 grasses do not form a homogeneous group concerning their ecological behavior (Ellis et al. 1980, Hattersley 1983, Vogel et al. 1986). In our case a comparison of C4 subfamilies showed that Eragrostoideae species have slightly lower moisture requirements (F mean around 2) than those from the Panicoideae (F averages around 3). It is also worth noting that there are more wild species from the Panicoideae than from the Eragros- toideae in Hungary.</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 15 (1991) 87 Figure S.

R (soil reaction) value (from l=acidophilia to 5=basiphilia, 0=indifferent). Data from Soó (1973). The relative dominance of weeds within the C4 group n'ight have an undesirable effect, that find- ings reflect the ruderal character rather than dif- ferences in fixation pathway. To test this hypothesis some ecological features of natural and weedy C4 species were compared. Only the N value was consistently different between them, so higher N requirements of C4 grasses compared to C3 ones can be attributed to their ruderal feature. However, even the natural C4 grasses have not shown lower N values than their C3 counterparts as expected by the higher nitrogen use efficiency. The author is well aware that the ecological in- dicator values with a scale ranging from 0 to 5 - based on field experience rather than measure- ments - give a relatively rough estimate of the ecological requirements. By their definition these ecological indicator values operate on different scales. While the T value reflects an environmen- tal factor changing over large geographical distan- ces, the F, R and N indices can show variation in a much smaller scale (E.
