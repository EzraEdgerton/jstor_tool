Data containing 13 quantitative and 13 qualitative characters are checked by cluster-analysis. The resulting dendrogram suggests that the formerly proposed phylogenetic relationship (Diill 1984) should be altered in some respects. It is also shown that cluster-analysis can be helpful in the identification of difficult taxa if one already suggests to which different taxa it could belong. By a different proce d'u r e of the same computer-program, the correlation between different characters was also calculated. INTRODUCTION Diill (1984) investigated 10 critical European D¿dymodon taxa by looking at the characters they have in common and those which separate them. Using the results and the geographical distribution of the taxa, he revealed their phylogenetic relationship. To learn if these relationships could be confirmed by a computer-analysis, data for the following taxa were examined by cluster-analysis: D&lt;Ldymodon /i¿g¿dLL¿u¿ Hedw. var. /ilgiduluò, D, /i. var. glauca ¿ (Ryan) Wijk &amp; Marg., D . /i . var. icmadopkiluò (Schimp. ex C.

The following quantitative characters were measured: leaf length, leaf width, the ratio of leaf-length and leaf-width, the ratio of leaf length and length of nerve, basal cells length, basal cells width, the ratio of basal cells length and basal cells width, mid-leaf cells length, mid-leaf cells width, the ratio of mid-leaf cells length and mid-leaf cells width, apex cells length, apex cells width, and the ratio of apex cells length and apex cells width. Table 1 shows the qualitative characters investigated. In measuring leaf- characters, great care was taken to use leaves well below the stem apex in order to make sure they were not too young. Three leaves of every individual and 3 cells in 3 different parts of every leaf were measured. In this way, 30 leaf-data and 90 different cell data have been utilized for every taxon. The qualitative characters given by Diill (1984) have been re-checked for every specimen and altered if necessary. It was thought necessary to get as many data as possible for the characterization of a taxon. In DicLymocLon, the taxa have already been investigated and are relatively well-known; therefore, the number of data mentioned above seem to be sufficient. But for investigating unknown taxa, it is necessary to obtain data from more than 10 specimens. Only then can we learn the range of variation of these taxa and place the specimens in their correct taxonomie positions. If only one specimen were chosen for each taxon or only means for every character and taxon were used, much information would be lost; if there were an atypical specimen among those measured, the data would be adulterated. Provided the taxa themselves are already well-known, it may perhaps be possible to take only 1 datum for every character and to reveal by cluster-analysis the relationship of different taxa. The data were analyzed by Ward's clustering algorithm using the CLUSTAN program package (Wishart 1984). By another procedure, correlations among characters were calculated. RESULTS As shown by simple sea t ter-d iagrams using only 2 different characters, the separation of DicLymocLon taxa is really difficult</page><page sequence="5">37 (Figs 1 and 2). Mostly, no distinct clusters for the taxa can be distinguished. In a former publication ( Diil 1-Hermanns 1984), the statistical distribution of quantitative characters of 7 of the 8 taxa used in the present work have been checked - normal or non-normal - and their significant differentiation determined. These results, together with qualitative characters and the geographical distribution of the taxa, were used by Diill (1984) Fig. 1.

According to this coefficient Didymodon /t¿g¿du¿uó var. g/iac¿¿¿ó and D , i, var. ¿cmado pk-ituò are the most closely related taxa (c3 = 9.308).

It is demonstrated that all investigated taxa belong to the same group by the fact that all are included in one cluster. Comparing these results with those given by Düll (1984), a good correspondence is recognized.

He treats the latter as a distinct species because of good differences. This decision is maintained here. He also proposes a close relationship between D . /ligidutu* var. and var. glauca* . He puts together the two varieties with D, i. var. giaci¿¿ó, var. ¿ cmado pkituò and var. vatiduò into one group, but he shows by a thinner line that the relationship is not as close as between the first ones. The dendrogram, however, demonstrates that the latter varieties belong to one cluster and that the relationship to D, i. var- i¿g¿du¿uó is not very close. According to the dendrogram and the coefficients of distance which show that there are good differences, it seems better not to treat the varieties giac¿¿¿ó and -temado ph¿¿uó as varieties of D. /i¿gidu¿u¿, but as varieties of D, acutum (Brid.) Saito. The correct combinations are thus D-idymodon acutum (Brid.) Saito var. acutum and D . a, var. ¿cmadophítuò (Schimp. ex C. Muell.) Zander which accords with Zander (1978).

Diill 1983), the second author was not sure of the correct position of D-icLymodon acu.tu.4 var, a, and var. ¿cmado ph.i¿uó , According to its higher distance coefficient, good differentiating characters and its special distribution mainly in the Alps, it seems correct to keep D, si, var. va¿¿du/&gt; as a distinct species, D, vat^duò Limpr. Crundwell and Nyholm (1965) separate D, va¿¿du.¿ and D, si¿gldu¿LLó and suggest a close relationship to D, acutum. But they reduce D. va¿¿du¿ to a synonym of D. acutàò which cannot be maintained by the present study. Cluster analysis can be used not only for demonstrating relationships but also for identifying unknown specimens. Among the chosen specimens, there was one that could not unequivocally be d e termi nd ed as D, si4.g±du¿u/&gt; var. si, or var. g£aucuò , Its data were used in a cluster analysis together with data of the two mentioned varieties. The resulting dendrogram is shown by Figure 5. Specimen 5 represents the data of the unknown specimen. In the dendrogram, it is found in the cluster formed by specimens of var. glacuò. Its position in the dendrogram shows it to be difficult to identify. It seems to lie between the two varieties. Its distance coefficient (c = 2.901) to the other specimens of the variety glauca* is much higher than those between all others: for example, the distance coefficient between specimen 11 an 16 is only c = 1.981. It is shown that cluster analysis can be useful for the determination of difficult specimens. It also shows how important it is to work with data from many specimens for a difficult taxon. If there are specimens not belonging to the taxon in question, they will turn out to be in a cluster. By a different procedure, correlations between the different characters were calculated. In most cases, no significant correlations exist. Only the following correlations were found to be significant:</page><page sequence="10">42 1. length of leaves to length of basal cells (r = 0.7064) 2. length of basal cells to ratio of length and width of the same cells (r = 0.7995) 3. length of mid-leaf cells to ratio of length and width of the same cells (r = 0.7693) 4. length of upper leaf cells to ratio of length and width of the same cells (r = 0.6100) Figure 6 shows the relationship between the length of leaves and 1 f. 3 10 e 15 12 18 7 4 8 8 e 5 11 11 13 16 19 2 8 8 9 11 11 20 13 U '7 111 I 1 if In-1 I ^ 1 In-1 Fig. 5.

It is demonstrated that all points are more or less close to the regression line, which means that these characters are positively correlated. Of course, because of high correlations the number of characters for the differentiation of the investigated taxa can be reduced. For qualitative characters, no high correlations were expected, and no calculations were performed.
