We investigated two elements of floristic study design: 1) the extent of the study, and 2) the strategy of locality choice. Different divisions of the area into categories of elevation, watersheds and geomor phological units were used as a basis for a systematic selection of localities. The numbers of species found in simulated floristic studies were compared with those of a random selection of localities of the same size. In a small number of localities (up to 100), the systematic choice of localities did not produce much better results than the random one; a marked improvement could be seen in the case of 180 localities (20% of the total). Strategies based on geomor phology and elevation were much more effective than those based on watersheds because of the greater inner homogeneity of their categories . INTRODUCTION It is widely known that the number of species found in a floristic study largely depends on the intensity of research in a particular area. However, the factor of the intensity of research is often not easily quantified, especially if the region under study does not comprise distinct units such as islands. Nevertheless, floristic or faunistic research is usually conducted by means of a detailed study of relatively small, representative localities; in that case the intensity of research may be divided into 3 components: (1) number of localities visited, (2) choice of localities within the area, (3) thoroughness of investigation carried out on each locality.</page><page sequence="2">20 Because of the difficulties in quantifying the third component, (it may be considered to be thoroughout the whole region), we shall consider the species list for each locality to be complete . In practical bryof lor ist ic research, we have to try to optimize both components, i.e., to choose the number of localities and their distribution within the area in a way that can be expected to yield the most complete floristic data on the area. This optimization is especially necessary if not enough time or money are available for the research. The aim of this study is to quantify this relation in one geographic area. As a model we used a detailed data set on hepatica distribution in the Nizký Jesenik Highland (Niederes Gesenke, Northern Moravia) and its surrounding areas (Duda 1983, 1984a, b and forthcoming papers). For the purpose of this study, this floristic material was considered to be compiste and we used it to simulate less extensive floristic studies as subsets of this set of localities. These subsets (i.e., individual simulated floristic studies) were defined by their extent, the number of localities visited and by the strategy of locality choice. In this study, the term strategy denotes a systematic choice of localities using a priori (i.e., not considering bryoflora) information on the region structure (e.g., elevation, geomor phology ) . The results of these studies were evaluated using the ratio of the number of species found in such a study to the total number of species in the whole area. STUDY AREA The location of the study area (3624 kma) is shown in Fig. 1. It comprises mainly the geomor phological units of Nízký JesenÍK (Highland) and Opavská pahorkatina (Hilly land) based on the regional division of Bohemia and Moravia (Czudek et al. 1972); its boundary is defined by the occurrence of the Lower Carboniferous graywacks and slates. The whole area covers 3624 km2, its altitude ranging from 203 to 900 m above sea level. A detailed description of the area was published by Duda (1983).</page><page sequence="3">21 METHODS The collecting tracks carried out in the area are shown in Fig. 2. Their routes were chosen to permit detailed investigation of the whole area. Altogether 939 localities were investigated. Each locality was visited only once. For the purpose of this paper, localities are defined by two main criteria : 1. Altitudinal span (about 50 m in hilly areas, about 10 m in flat areas) 2. Size of the locality - a 5 km stretch of the bottom of a valley - on a mountain slope - rectangle 2 km x 5 km - the top of a hill- the circle 500 m in diameter - the upland plateau - the circle 5 km in diameter - an isolated hill is included in one locality unless where its altitude exceeds 50 m - in the valleys of big rivers, left and right banks were included as separate localities - the pond was included as one locality - the abandoned gravel works were included as one locality Fig. 1.

All species were collected at each locality with the exception of Lo ph.ocote.ci h.e.te./io pky ila , which is common in the woods in the whole area. As a result, this species was not included in the data set at all. Published records were not taken into account, since they do not report complete data on localities . Fig. 2.

The number of species ranged from 1 to 22 species per locality, averaging 4.36 species per locality. The following divisions of the area were chosen for the simulation of different strategies of locality selection. Wherever possible, the resulting division included the same number of localities. The basic descriptions of these divisions are given in Table 1.</page><page sequence="6">24 1. Watersheds. The area was divided into the watersheds of the eight biggest rivers: the Osoblaha (OS), the Opava (OP), the Opava - the lower part of its stream from the confluence with the Moravice (0P2), the Moravice (MC), the Odra (OD), the Morava (MO), the Bystřice (BY), and the Bečva (BE). 2. Geomor phology . The geomor phological subunits in the regional division of Bohemia and Moravia (Czudek et al. 1972) were used as basic regions. In a few cases geomor phological subunits containing a small number of localities were fused with the neighbouring subunits. 3. Elevation. The localities were classified into 4 categories in the range from the minimum to maximum altitude. The individual categories had the following ranges: VI (206-345 m); V 2 (345-484 m); V3 (484-622 m); V4 (622-900 m). The individual "floristic studies" were simulated as subsets of the basic set of 939 localities. These simulated "floristic studies" were defined by 1) the number of localities visited, i.e., by the extent of the study; and 2) the strategy of locality selection. Using these subdivisions, we proceeded in the following way to obtain the required locality selection. To obtain the required number of localities (e.g., 20%) of the total we chose an equal portion of localities from each category of the respective subdivision. Within the categories, localities were selected using a pseudorandom number generator. For a given subdivision and number of localities, we repeated the simulation 50 times. For comparison, we used the random choice of a required number of localities from the whole data set irrespective of the subdivision of the area. The complete documentation on which this paper is based is filed in the Silesian Museum (Opava). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The random choice of localities irrespective of the division of the area produced an essentially logarithmic increase in</page><page sequence="7">25 number of species with the number of localities visited (logarithmic curve model: y = 1.012 + 0.162 In x, ra = 0.999; power curve model: y = 1.146 + 0.333 In x, r2= 0.960), (Fig. 3). Locality selection using any of the above strategies yielded better results than random choice (Fig. 4). In general, the selection of 10% of the total number of localities using any form of area subdivision did not produce conspicuously better results than random choice. However, in the case of a higher number of localities, the strategy of directed choice led to much better results than random choice.

Thereafter the effectiveness of the strategy based on watersheds approached that based on elevation and geomor phology . Importantly, the results obtained are dependent on the structure of the data set used for simulation. Therefore, the Fig. 4a. Systematic choice of localities using watersheds ( semi logar i thmic graph)</page><page sequence="9">27 validity of any general conclusion drawn from these results depends on the variability of such structures in different areas. This variability comprises two components: (1) the floristic structure of the area (Primarily alpha and beta diversity of the flora) (2) the way in which this structure is expressed in the floristic study (locality definition, division of the area Fig. 4b.

These factors are generally unknown in an area chosen for a floristic study, and all the decisions rely solely on the experience of the bryologist based on similar areas. The crucial step is to distinguish the factors which determine the floristic Fig. Ac. Systematic choice of localities using elevation categories ( semilogar ithmic graph)</page><page sequence="11">29 composition of the localities. This allows us to construct a classification of localities maximizing be tween-subuni t s variability and minimizing wi thin-subuni t variability which enables us to make the most effective choice.' This seems to be illustrated by our results. Since there is a fixed amount of variance in the data set, the more homogeneous the subunits of a division are the greater is the amount of the total between- -locality variability expressed by their division into subunits. The amount of wi thin-subuni t variability may be assessed by comparing the number of species of a given subunit with that expected for the random choice of localities of the same size (Fig. 5). In this respect, there is a marked difference between Fig. 5. Number of species in the individual categories of three divisions of the area used for systematic choice. The line of random expectation is indicated.</page><page sequence="12">30 the three classifications. Geomor phology and elevation produced fairly homogeneous units which are generally represented by points under the line of random expectation, i.e., contain less species than expected. Therefore, the strategies based on these classifications were the most effective. Conversely, the low predictive power of watershed division is due to greater heterogeneity of the subunits. In a similar study, Pospíšil and Pospíšilová (1982) demonstrated the effect of the proper choice of factors used for area subdivision and sampling. They collected 80% of the total number of species to be found in the Spišská Magura mountains in a detailed study of only one percent of the total mountain area. This representative fraction of the area was selected to cover the whole elevation range and all types of geological substrata occurring in the area. However, these factors were known to be important in determining bryoflora during floristic studies carried ot in the surrounding areas. In general, a real bryof lor istic study differs from our model in several important respects: 1. The criteria for locality selection often depend more on ecological criteria, especially when smaller localities are examined . 2. Knowledge of species behaviour in the region may be used for locality selection. 3. Though at the outset all studies rely only on non-f loristic information, they proceed heur i s t ica 1 1 y and use data gained by the correlation of bryophyte occurrence with non- floristic factors as a guide for further research. It should be stressed that our study cannot give any general rule for the extent of the floristic study even if all these factors are taken into account. The extent of any study should be determined primarily by the specific aim of the study, which in turn specifies the degree of effort versus accuracy or completeness .</page><page sequence="13">31 REFERENCES Czudek, T.
