<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abstracta Botanica 9, Suppl. 2:45-54, 1985 ZYGODON IN EUROPE AND MACARONESIA, WITH SPECIAL REGARD TO CENTRAL EUROPE Ruprecht DÜLL Universität Duisburg, FB 6, Botanik, Lotharstr. 1, D-4100 Duisburg, German Federal Republic All ZygodLon taxa known from Europe and Macaronesia have been found in Germany. These taxa were studied in the field and the herbarium. Their taxonomy, ecology and distribution in Germany and Europe are described. An identification key for all taxa is presented . INTRODUCTION In the past few years, I studied different Zygcdon taxa in the field and also examined many herbarium specimens, e.g., more than a hundred in DUIS (hb. F. Koppe., F. Neu and R. Diill). Cultivation experiments were also carried out. Cultivation is very simple on wet sterile sand with "Knoopsche Nährlösung" as substrate . TAXONOMY OF ZYGODON The following general characters were used: autoecious or dioecious. Leaves flexuose or twisted when dry, spreading to recurved when moist, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, acute, margin entire or sometimes fdenticulate towards apex, nerve ending below apex (or rarely excurrent). Basal cells short to longly rectangular, hyaline, smooth. Upper cells rounded to hexagonal, often obscure, thick-walled and mostly papillose. Smooth, (mostly) uniseriate stem gemmae frequently present. Costa with basal deuters. Seta long. Capsule ovoid to ellipsoid, pyriform or shortly cylindrical with 8 longitudinal striae, smooth when dry, plicate when empty. Calyptra smooth, cuculiate, peristome in European species double (teeth of exostome in pairs) or absent.</page><page sequence="2">46 Distribution world-wide (according to Smith 1978) with about 90 species (8 taxa in Europe and Macar onesia ) . According to Malta (1926), there are two sections, Biyolde.0 and ¿ uzygodon ♦ 1. Sect. B/iyo¿de.ó: Cells relatively wide, thin-walled. Leaves smooth. Peristome double. Distribution predominantly in the southern hemisphere (9 species according to Malta 1926), in the tropics and subtropics of East Africa, Ceylon, South America and especially in Australasia and New Zealand. The dioecious species are limited to Java, South America and Australasia. The only species limited to Europe and Madeira is Zygodon 1.oiòte.i&lt;L, Z. made.¿/ie.n¿&lt;L4 is a synonym of Z. fioiòte./i&lt;L (pers. comm. by C. Sergio ) . 2. Sect. Zygodon (=Euzygodon C. Muell.): Mid-leaf cells about 10-12 m wide, thick-walled and ¿papillose. Peristom often reduced or not developed. Distribution world-wide. All other taxa of Europe, Western Asia, Macaronesia and N. America belong here. KEY TO ZYGODON IN EUROPE, MACARONESIA AND W. ASIA 1 Leaves smooth. Mid-leaf cells 14-18 (-24) yum wide. Autoecious, mostly c.spg., capsule narrowly pyriform. Only on bark. Z. £o/is&gt;te./ii Upper part of leaf ¿papillose, mid-leaf cells 12 yum or less wide. Dioecious, sporophytes very rare. 2 2 Plants 2-5 cm high, often toothed towards apex. Midleaf cells about 10 /im wide, basal cells longly rectangular, 1:3-6 times as long as wide, with thickened walls. Gemmae absent or very rare. Capsule with peristome. Only on limestone rocks (and walls) in the Alps, Poland and Great Britain (Yorkshire). Z. g/iac¿¿ió Not with this combination of characters. Plants never higher than 2 cm. Gemmae present, usually very common. Mostly on bark. 3</page><page sequence="3">47 3 Gemmae to 6 cells long, with some longitudinal cell walls. 4 Gemmae without longitudinal cell walls 5 4 Leaves ofteti toothed towards apex. Mid-leaf cells 10-12 pm wide, basal cells thin-walled, rectangular, 1:3-6 long. Longitudinal walls of gemmae often somewhat curved. Very rare on limestone, almost always on bark, especially in the Alps (less common in higher mountains in Central and E. Europe and N. America.) Z, cLe.ntatu¿ Leaves entire, never with a single tooth. Mid-leaf cells 7-9 (-12) /jim wide. Basal cells relatively short, 1:2-3, thick-walled. Longitudinal walls of gemmae straight.

Sergio (pers. comm.) who examined the type-specimen, Z. madLe.À./ie.nò±ò is only a synonym of Z. f.o/u&gt;te.n.±*</page><page sequence="4">48 The variety òendLtne.iì. is only a modification with an excurrent costa without any taxonomical worth. Distribution in Germany (all specimens with sporophy t es ) : very rare in Schleswig-Holstein (no specimen seen, but from Haderslev, now Denmark). For Nieder sachsen (all data from the last century) no herbarium specimen was available, but Hiibner's records are not doubtful. Rheinland: around Köln, up to 1950* Rheinland-Pfalz: St. Goar (1870)* and Zweibrükken (ca. 1980)* Baden: Ketsch near Mannheim (ca. 1950, doubtful). Near the German border near Strasbourg (ca. 1830)* General distribution: a euoceanic-medi terranean species. Most of the known localities in Europe are in W- and S-France* (one is close to the Swiss border at Mt . Saleve *). Rare in all other countries: S-England to 52° north)* Pyrenees (unknown if France or Spain)*, Spain (Huesca, Catalania, Andalusia, Casas* (pers. comm.), Portugal (Estremadura, C. Sergio * (pers. comm.), Italy (Florence *, etc.) Sardinia (ca. 1930)* Austria (Tirol, Heiligenblut, t. Malta (1926), last century), Yugoslavia (Istria (ca. 1850)*, Is. of Krk, leg by Diill 1982), Dalmatia), Greece (Parnas)* and Madeira (C. Sergio, pers. comm.)*. It is said to occur also in N. Africa. Only in lower elevations, mostly up to ca. 200 m in Germany and 300 m in Catalania, but also in the coastal plains. Ecology: only on bark of deciduous trees, rare on rotten logs of Taguò . Mostly on Tagaò, but in Yugoslavia on Que/icuò and Oòt/iya. At the base of trees, in branch holes (together with Anacaptodon up to 3 m high. Associated with Lejeunea u¿¿c¿na, fte.tzge.iia and O/itfiot/iickum . More or less basiphil. Sensitive to air-pollution. 2. Z. conoideas (Dicks.) Hook. &amp; Tayl., Muscol. Brit. 71, t. 24, 1818; syn. Z# vÀ./iÀ.dLÀ.òòimu.ò var, H/ievi1.o¿-iuó Warnst. Taxonomy: in the last century often confused with Z. but very different in all characters. Distribution in Central Europe: formerly quite common in western</page><page sequence="5">49 Schleswig-Holstein* and north western Niedersachsen* , but now more and more decreasing. In the Rheinland and Belgium in the Eifel/Venn (in Germany till 1930*, in Belgium up to 650 m till now)* In the rest of Germany only very rare in Idar- Hochwald/Rheinland-Pf alz (1936*). All other German records are misidentifications. General distribution: an euroceanic moss of western Europe, north to Faroes, Norway (to 61°37! n.b.), S. -Sweden, Xlands and Scotland. In Ireland*, Great Britain* and France* with sporophytes (in other countries only sterile). In the Netherlands very rare, at last in Drente distr. (till 1971: Vogelpoel 1976). Wallis once. Very rare in Spain* and Portugal*, Madeira and Canary Islands. Eastern Canada in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia*. The Siberian specimen is a misindentif icat ion , as are also the mediterranean records. In Germany, it prefers the coastal plains, but occurs also in montane elevations (highest known on Tenerife: 900 m). Ecology: on bark of deciduous trees (Taguò, Qae/ica¿ and others) and shrubs (esp. Sam&amp;ucu¿) in humid forests, but also in hedges and along roads in Schleswig-Holstein. Associated with basi- and calciphilous species, as (Yletzge/i¿a -/Laicata, ī iattanza and Ne.cke.ia comptanata . Often with 0/ith.ot/iÀ.c.h.am species. Sensitive to air-pollution. 3. Z, dentata* Breidl. ex Jur. in Laubmoosfl. in Österr.- Ungarn 1882; syn.: Z. v±/iÁ.d±ó¿¿maó var. dentata ¿ (Breidl. ex Jur . ) Limpr . Taxonomy: a well-characterized taxon. The broodbodies and, e.g., also the cells, are different from those of Z. v±/i¿d¿ó¿¿ma¿ . The teeth are mostly developed in this taxon, but never in Z. D±i¿dióó¿ma¿ . Last but not least, the distribution of the next similar Z. v&lt;L/iÁ.d¿4ó±ma¿ s. str. excludes more or less (see S. Schwarzwald) that of Z, dentata ¿ in Europe. Z. dentata ò prefers higher elevations. The lowest locality konwn is 440 m* in Bavaria, but it mostly occurs over 800 m to 1100 m. The</page><page sequence="6">50 highest point in Bavaria is in Allgäu (1300 m)* At Achensee/N. Tyrolean Austria, it was collected at 1400 m* and at 1700 m in Transylvania (the highest known). Distribution in C. Europe and adjacent areas: in Germany in Bavaria in the Alps quite common (also twice with 1(*) spg.; all other specimens sterile) and also in the Voralpen not rare. Single localities in Fichtelgebirge* and Bayerischer Wald and Hochebene, e.g. near Altötting*. Also on Adelegg* and in S. Schwarzwald* and in the neighbouring Vosges* in France. In the adjacent Austrian* and Swiss Alps* relatively rare, but probably often overlooked. General distribution: outside the Alps rare. One record in Norway (Telemarken 60°n.b.). Tatra*, Carpathian* and Transy lvanian Alps (Herzog in Malta 1926). A record from Arizona needs confirmation (Johnsen and Vitt 1971). Altogether this is a northern suboceanic, more or less European species with a mainly alpine distribution. It seems to occur only in formerly glaciated (rich, often calcareous) areas of the last ice-age. Ecology: on bark of deciduous trees, especially on Tagaò and Ace./i platanoidzò, but also on T/iax.inuò, Py/iuò, Tilia, etc.; in the Allgäu also found on A&amp;ie.ó and Picea, K. Koppe has found it in the Allgäu twice on limestone-rocks* The moss is associated with the usual calciphilous bryophytes. It prefers open and humid, but mostly not sunny habitats, at first on single old trees and also at the forest-borders, especially next to streams and lakes. Specimens from the type locality (Steiermark: Radmertal bei Eisenerz, lg. J. Breidler 20.5.1878: cit. Malta 1926: 106) are sterile. Sporophytes have been collected near Bad Tölz (lg. Molendo 1860: M*; described in Malta 1926: 48) and in Allgäu by K. Koppe (specimen not discoverable *). 4. Z. g/iaciliò Wils, ex Berk., Handb. Brit.

The only specimen in our area is perfectly restricted to calcareous rock habitats and to the alpine region. Records from N. America are incorrect. Lowest localities about 900 m (Pitztal /Tirol*) and 830 m (Allgäu*). Mostly over 1000 m, in Bavaria to 1830 m; highest record 2100 m (S. Tirol/Italy*). Distribution in Germany: only Voralpen, Allgäu and Bavarian Alps, east to Kampenwand near Chiemsee. Very rare, but often overlooked (habit like D¿dymodon f.e./1/iagi.ne.aò ) . Also in the Austrian (only Tirol*), Italian (S. Tirol*) and Swiss Alps (Berner Oberland*, Appenzell*, Schwyz*). Very rare with sporophytes and broodbodies: near Matrei in E. Tirol (K. Koppe 1935*) and Berner Oberland once c.spg. Higher Tatra in CSSR and Poland. Outside the continent in N. England (Yorkshire, ca. 53°30f n.b. once c.spg.; 1. cl). An oceanic-alpine species (palaeorelictic?) . Ecology: open to shaded, humid rocks of limestone, calcareous schists and "Nagelfluh". In N. England on limestone walls. 5.

Taxonomy: differs from ssp. kau.mgaitne./L¿ only in the gemmae with longitudinal walls, and in preferring more rich bark (and areas) and in the oceanic distribution. Altogether only worth accepting as a subspecies. Sporophytes were found only in Great Britain* and Portugal* Distribution in Germany: Z. v&lt;L/i¿dj.¿ó¿muó s. str. outside the plains is much less common than ssp.

Poland (( Schi velbein/Pommern ) Suiduin, 15°40' E. of Greenwich)*, An isolated locality in Brandenbur g/GDR reaches nearly 13° E. In W. Germany all records come from 10° E. and less. The most southern locality in C. Europe is in N. Switzerland in the Oberrheintal near Basel. Previously in the plains, the species occurs in the</page><page sequence="8">52 mountains up to 500 m in N. Schwarzwald* and (one loc.*) at 700 m in the Oberen Donautal (F. Koppe)* General distribution: similar to that of Z. cono¿de.u¿p but in C. Europe a little more to the east. South to SW France, Portugal* and Spain*. No specimen seen from real Mediterranean areas, but also in Macaronesia and recorded (only sterile) from E. N. America and Venezuela. Ecology: especially on bark of deciduous trees in areas close to the coast and in wet forests of the Rheintal (an extensive account is given by Philippi 1968). In Nord-Rhein- Westfalen often on limestone and walls. Associated with the usual calciphilous bryophytes. More or less sensitive to air-pollution and in polluted areas, like the Rheinland, now only on stones. 5a. Z. d ±/iid¿ó ó ¿mu. 6 ssp. vi/iidiòòimuò var. òtiitonii (Schimp. ex Stirt.) Hag., Kgl.

Taxonomy: the leaves with excurrent costa and the northern oceanic distribution make this taxon worth to be classified as a variety . Distribution: northern distribution similar to Z. conoídeuò (in Norway to Ostfold), east to Samland ( ( Georganwalde* ) Salezajevo*; 20° E. of Greenwich, now Soviet Union), Rügen (13°30f E. of Gr.; also on bark *) and Thüringer Wald/GDR (Meinunger pers. comm.), Möen/Denmark (Malta 1926). In FDR very rare and only in the lower mountains. The record from Flensburg/Schleswig-Holstein (Prahl) is doubtful (on earth), also from Loffenau/N. Schwarzwald.
