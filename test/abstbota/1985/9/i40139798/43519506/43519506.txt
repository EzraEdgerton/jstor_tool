<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abstracta Botanica 9, Suppl. 2:119-121, 1985 NEW RESULTS FROM FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY OF BRYOPHYTES Gisela NORDHORN-RICHTER Im Brüch 23, D-4130 Moers 1, German Federâl Republic Primary fluorescence cannot be observed in all structures of bryophyte cells nor for all species. Some new examples for fluorescing and non-f luor esc ing structures are demonstrated. Contamination of bryophytes with fungal cells can be easily detected by fluorescence microscopy. At the 3. Meeting of the CEBWG in Praha the first slides of primary fluorescence were shown. In the meantime, investigations with the fluorescence microscope brought about more hints as to the differences in the chemical composition of cell structures of bryophytes. For recollection: primary fluorescence can be observed when bryophytes are irradiated with ultra-violet or blue-light (Nordhorn-Richter 1984 a,b). Vegetative propagation forms of bryophytes fluoresce very intensively as can be shown for 7 et/iaph±/&gt; pellucida or for Leucodon sciuroides, where the deciduous branchlets give a nice design. In these cases the plasma contains the fluorescing compounds just as in the case of fluorescing spores (e.g. spores of Phaeoce/ioò taeuí-ò) . Sometimes the primary fluorescence is quenched by cell wall structures of the exine as can be demonstrated for Anth.0ce.100 punctata^ . The peristome shows primary fluorescence as well, as has been shown for Leptoü/iyum py/i&lt;L-ļ.oime (Nordhorn-Richter 1984b), and can be demonstrated with still closed capsules, too. The same impression is given by the peristomes of 7 on.te.tta &lt;LnļL £, e.x. a and Oithot/i-ichum d¿aphaniLm, But, as mentioned before for spores, there can be found peristome teeth without primary fluorescence, for instance in Bait/iam¿a hatte/iiana and also B, pom±{.oim&lt;Lò or Po gonatum a¿o±deó .</page><page sequence="2">120 These examples verify that the cell wall compounds of bryophytes are not of equal chemical composition: there are some species with compounds consisting of phenolic structures (which are responsible for primary fluorescence) and those having none at all or having phenolic compounds that quench primary fluorescence (therefore appearing black under blue-light radiation). While the leaves of 7 hu¿d¿um tamai¿óc¿num appear whitish-blue under the fluorescence microscope due to the cuticular-papillae , the cell walls of Sphagnum. au /i ¿cu ¿atam and S, mag e. ¿¿an ¿cum as well as the walls of the conducting tissue of lo/ite.¿¿a to/ituo^a fluoresce yellow-green. The cell walls of De.nd/io¿¿got/L¿ckum de.nd/io¿de.ó , which are said to contain 1 ignin-r esembl ing compounds (Scheirer 1972), show reddish fluorescence (the lignin of higher plants has a whitish primary fluorescence ) . Another possibility of investigation is given by using the fluorescence microscope: hyphae and spores of fungi have cell walls of chitin, a compound without phenolic groups and without primary fluorescence. Investigations of bryophyte tissue under the fluorescence microscope disclosed contaminations of fungi very easily as can be shown for the leaf-tissue of Pt¿¿¿d¿um pu¿ch.e./i/i¿mum where hyphae grow along the cell walls. The leaf cells of Le.p¿doz¿a izptanò seem to be contaminated with fungal hyphae, a similar observation has been published by Pocock and Duckett (1984) from thalloid hepatics. On the spores of C¿adopod¿e.¿¿a -/Lianc¿óc¿ spores of fungi have been found, which seem to penetrate into the cells just by hyphae. Even hyphae growing out of cells of the capsule of ¿p¿pte./iy g¿um toze.i¿ can easily be detected. Animal tissues may also consist of chitin, so the fluorescence method is a possibility to divide bulbils of bryophytes from galls affected by animals on rhizoids of bryophytes. On a specimen of Pok¿¿a c/iuda (BM) pretty bulbils have been detected on rhizoids. These structures could not be integrated into any known group. They seem to consist of only</page><page sequence="3">121 one cell and this was a hint for animal galls. After investigation with fluorescence microscope, there is a convincing sign that they have a zoological origin: they do not show any primary fluorescence REFERENCES Nordhorn-Richter, G. 1984a.
