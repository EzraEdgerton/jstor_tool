AN EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION OF AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM TO SOME BEECH WOOD TYPES OF THE APENNINES* Enrico FEOLI and Paola GANIS Department of Biology, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy, 1-34100 The comparison of floristic vegetation types on the basis of multiway contingency tables obtained by considering the properties of the species (structural, morphological, anatomical, chemical, chorological , etc.), is suggested to improve the interpretation of the relationships between the types. The construction of the multiway contingency tables allows us to combine different vegetation spaces which are considered relevant for understanding of vegetation structure and processes. An example of application of an information system integrating the use of a data bank and multivariate methods is given by comparing some types of beech woods of the Apennines. The ordination of the types described by three-way contingency tables obtained by the cross life form-growth form-chorological element, proves to be more predictive with respect to ecological indicator values than the ordinations based on the species, sind on the life form-growth form and chorological spectra joined in one table as if they were independent variables (canonical correlation analysis was applied for measuring prediction) . The classification sind ordination of the types on the basis of some statistics of the contingency tables prove that the predictability between texture and chorology of vegetation may be considered a good descriptor of vegetation. The predictability of texture towards chorology and vice versa is strongest in the types of peculiar environments (e.g., on acid soils, on soils with high drainage). * Work supported by Italian CNR and.

Such a description is obviously a consequence of the information carried by the species that the 'agent' wishes to select for the analysis (see Dale 1977). Although the species concept is critical, and several times it has been critized for ecological comparisons (e.g., Schmid 1965, Harper 1982), we think it is still the most convenient one. We know that within the so-called species there are several morphological and chemical variations due to ecological influences, but the study of vegetation cannot wait for the description of all the wi thin-species variations. As a matter of fact, on several occasions it has been proved that the study of within species variations has been facilitated by a previous vegetation classification (e.g., Grabherr 1979, Coassini Lokar et al. 1984). The definition of local vegetation types on the basis of floristic data should be considered as a first step to the study of vegetation variation from the local to continental and world scale level. Pragmatically, it should be considered as a way to simplify the vegetation study (see Cristofolini 1984, Feoli 1984). We also know that in some environments the identification of species is difficult and, at times, impossible; in this case the use of dummy names, for the set of individuals considered similar enough to belong to the same species, should generally solve the problem. Feoli (1984) distinguishes several vegetation spaces in which vegetation types may find their position. The vegetation spaces can be combined in several ways. The combinations may solve the problem of comparing the vegetation types by taking into account the pattern of the links between the different characters. In this paper we present an example of combination</page><page sequence="3">3 of structural and chorological spaces by three-way contingency tables defined by life froms, growth forms and chorological elements. Each such table is a three dimensional array describing a vegetation type. The entries in the table are the sum of the scores of the species belonging to the combination (l(i) , g(i), c(i)), where 1 ( i ) is the i-th life form, g(i) the i-th growth form and c(i) the i-th chorological element present in a given type. In this way each vegetation type finds its position in a space of as many dimensions as there are the combinations ( l(i), g(i), c(i)). This space allows us to take into account the structure and the geographical distribution of the species at the same time, i.e. the characters useful for an ecological interpretation and the characters related to historical facts concerning species dispersion. In this way the species do not enter directly in the analysis, they remain only the carriers of the information that we think useful for the comparisons. DATA, METHODS AND COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR THE EXAMPLE The data used for the example are taken from the data bank of forest vegetation of the Apennines constructed by the packages SBAFT (Lagonegro et al. 1982, Lagonegro 1985) and FUSAF (Ganis 1985). A synthetic description of the software with examples for taxonomie and phytogeographic uses has been given by Feoli and Ganis (1984). In SBAFT the life forms are coded according to Pignatti (1982), while the chorological elements are coded according to Poldini (unpublished) . A set of synthetic tables corresponding to 16 vegetation types of beech woods defined by Feoli and Lagonegro (1982) has been used (Table 1). The types have been selected from the bank and treated by the package FUSAF, which also prepared the input for SPSS (Nie et al. 1975) and THREE-PA (Lagonegro and Feoli 1984). The program CROSSTAB of SPSS was used to obtain the three dimensional contingency tables (life forms-growth forms - chorological elements) for each vegetation type. Again, FUSAF has been used to build up the table T(l, g, c) describing the 16 types on the</page><page sequence="4">4 Table 1.

The types</page><page sequence="5">5 have been classified using the similarity ratio function of MLTAX1 and simple linkage, group average and complete linkage clustering (Anderberg 1973) by program CLUSTER (these two programs take part of THREE-PA) . The eigenvectors of the similarity ratio matrix have been used for ordinations (Feoli 1977). The types have been compared also on the basis of the statistics given by CROSSTAB suitable for nominal data, i.e., Cramer's V, contingency coefficient, Lambda asymmetric with life form-growth form dependent, Lambda asymmetric with chorological element dependent, Lambda symmetric, uncertainty coefficient asymmetric with life form-growth form dependent, uncertainty coefficient asymmetric with chorological element dependent, and uncertainty coefficient symmetric. All these parameters describe the links between life form-growth form and chorological elements in the types. They range between 0 sind 1, 1 denoting the complete link and elimination of uncertainty, i.e., each life form-growth form corresponding to only one chorological element. Such parameters can be used to measure the degree of "predictability" of the life form-growth form with respect to the chorological elements and vica versa. They may be considered as characters of the types. A classification of the types on the basis of these parameters has been obtained by the method of sum of squares (SSA, Orlòci 1978). The types have been ordered also on the basis of the species (frequency data) and on the basis of the tables combining the life form-growth form and chorological spectra as if they were independent. The same methods and programs used for the table T ( 1, g, c) have been applied. The results of ordinations are discussed in terms of predictivity with respect to the ecological indicator values (Table 1) already computed for the types by Feoli and Lagonegro (1982) according to Landolt (1977). The analysis of predictivity has been performed by canonical correlation analysis (see Gittins 1979) between the first two components of the matrix in Table 1 and the second and third eigenvectors of the similarity ratio matrix obtained by the table T(l, g, c), the second and</page><page sequence="6">6 Table 2.

Symbols as in Fig. 1.</page><page sequence="11">11 DISCUSSION From Figure 1 we can see that the classifications based on the table T(l,g,c) have given results very similar to those obtained by Feoli and Lagonegro (1982) based on species groups, i.e., the types of the same association are placed close in the dendrograms. The types of T io ckLtcantko -Factum constitute a close cluster both in the dendrogram given by average linkage and by complete linkage. Only in the case of single linkage is T ioch.L4canth.o- F agetum Lu^uLeto^um vai . with Se.4JLe.1La autumnatL* separated from the main group by the types of VoLy.4tLch.o- Fagetum . The dendrogram by single linkage proves the relative continuous structure (see Orlòci 1978) of the space of the combinations (l(i), g(i), c(i)). Aquifolio -Fag, et um is clearly more dispersed in such a space than the other associations; as a matter of fact only the dendrogram by complete linkage presents it as a cluster although without AquLfioLLo-F age turn biach.pod.Leto 4 um vai . with Queicu 4 -¿-¿ex. Average linkage proves the similarity between the types on the most acid soil, i.e., V eion.Lc.o-F agetum and Lucuto pedemontaaae- F agetum. The ordination of Figure 2 shows how the types belonging to the same association are also structurally and chorologically similar. In this ordination DLg.LtaLL-Fag.etum gets near to ¡&gt; o Ly.4tLch.0-F agetum as is also happening in the dendrogram by average linkage and complete linkage (Figure 1). Again, ? o Ly4tLch.o-F agetum has a central position, as in the case of ordination given by discriminant variates based on indicator values and the ordination given by concentration analysis (Feoli and Lagonegro 1982). If we consider the combination that in each type reaches a maximal value and we draw on the ordination scattergram of Figure 2 the lines joining the types with maximal values in the same combination, we get Figure 4. In all the associations the combinations with the maximal values are European-scapose-hemi- cryptophytes or rhizomatous geophytes (see Table 2). Only in f o Ly4tLch.o-F agetum scapose hemicryptophytes have maximal values in both the types. We could interpret the pattern in Figure 4 as</page><page sequence="12">12 Fig. 4. Superposition on the ordination of Figure 2 of the lines including the same association and the lines joining via a minimum spanning tree the types in which the combination European-Scapose-Hemicryptophytes ( • ) and the combination Rhizomatous-Geophytes (Eurasiatic= ▲ ; others= ■ ) are dominant.</page><page sequence="13">13 suggesting two series of beech wood types, one with understory "dominated" by scapose - hemicryptophytes and the other by rhizomatous-geophytes. If we follow the line connecting the points of the first series according to the main path of minimum spanning tree (11,14,9,7,21,20,17) a clear gradient of temperature is detected (indicator values respectively 3.8, 3.6, 3.3, 3.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.0, see Table 1); the same if we consider the series 13, 12, 15, 10, 6, 19, 16, 18 (indicator values respectively 3.7, 3.6, 3.6, 3.4, 3.2, 3.2, 3.0, 3.0). The existence of these two series, that are present within almost all the associations defined on floristic basis, should be explained in terms of some ecological differences. European-scapose-hemicryptophytes dominate in types on more acidic soils, with more humus and with lesser quantity of light arriving at understory level. The classification of the types on the basis of sum of squares applied to data in Table 3 presents three main groups of types (Figure 3). One group is given by 0&lt;Lg,¿ta¿¿-Fag,e.tum and Lu^ulo-F apetum, which shows the highest predictability of life form-growth form-chorology . Another group (6, 7, 13, 15, 12, 8, 11, 14) including Aquj-f.oZ-Lo-Fag.e.tum, V e.fionLc.o-F ag,e.£um and ?o¿y.4tLcko-Fag,e.tum has an intermediate predictability, while the third group given by T lockLtcantko-F ag.e.tum has the lowest predictability. The types with the highest predictability are those in more extreme ecological conditions: high drainage for D¿g.¿ta&lt;L¿-F ag,e.tum, low pH for Lu$ulo-F ag,e.tum. If we consider the geographic pattern of the types we can conclude that the predictability is decreasing in the northern regions, Tsioch¿4cantko-Fag,e.tum is the northernmost of the considered types. The results of canonical correlation analysis presented in Table 4 prove that the most predictive ordination with respect to indicator ecological values is the one based on table T(l,g, c), however the other ordinations are good enough. The advantage of using the combination life form-growth forms-chorology for</page><page sequence="14">14 describing the types lies in the fact that the information concerning the structure and the chorology of the types is integrated and not independent.
