FLUX OF NUTRIENTS IN A HORNBEAM - OAK FOREST Eduard Bub linee Department of Ecology and Natural Environment, Forest Research Institute, Zvolen, Slovak Socialistic Republic /Czechoslovakia/ Results demonstrated here were obtained in the framework of the International Biological Programme /IBP/ on research object in the Slovak Republic in 1971-1977. The basic goal was the study of individual components of the macronutrient cycling in the ecosystem of Carpathian hornbeam - oak forest. This part of ecosystem research may be regarded as the most laborious. To substantiate this let us remark that only for nutrients identification in individual parts of vegetation organs in woody plants 2589 laboratory determinations of element were made. The IBP programme is directly connected with Man and Biosphere programme /MaB/. In the heart of this is the research of function, productivity and structure of beech ecosystems which originally existed in Slovakia in different forms on more than 5o % of the surface of forest land. Even at present the beech forests in relatively pure up to monoculture form are spread on a quarter of forest surface. At the same time the cycling of bioelements even in different alternative, pre- dominantly spruce and pine ecosystems is being investigated. Out of the extensive research only several summarizing results are further given. Research was carried on at the research object near Báb /48^1 1 ' N and 17°54 ' Е/ . This site is situated about 7o km NE from Bratislava, the capital of SSR. It is in a chernozem area, agriculturally intensively used for a long time. Forest associations represented by the research object occupy 22,3 % from the forest land of Slovakia. The object, from the forestry</page><page sequence="2">- 9o - angle, represents also coppice forests /about 12 % of the forest surface/. This area belongs geographically to the Danube lowlands. The research object is situated in a warm climate region, defined by over 5o summer days with maximal temperature 25°C and above, in a dry district A^. Thus it belongs also to the warmest and dryest districts of the Slovak Socialistic Repub- lic with sunshine in the growth period over 15oo hours. Annual precipitations total is about 57o mm /growth period - 315 mm/, evaporation 48o mm. Average annual temperature is 9,3°C, in the growth period it is 16,2°C. Hydrothermic coefficient oscillates between 1,1 and 1,3, while the hydrothermic co- efficient = 1 is approximately the draught limit, or, the boundary between forest and steppe, respectively. The parent substrate for the soils is loess. The soil on the experimental area belongs to the soil type of brown earths, subtype chernozem brown earth. The neighbouring agri- cultural land belongs to a specific subtype brown chernozem. The forest ecosystem is composed in lo-5o % by oaks /Quercus petraea, Q. cerris, Q. robur/, in 6o % by hornbeam /Carp i nus betulus/ and in lo % by maple /Acer campestre/. The age of the association in the time of the research was 78 years. Accord- ing to the Zürich-Montpellier school this association may be placed in the union of Carpinion betuli /MAYER 1937, OBERDORFER 1953/ and it has common features with the associ- ation Primulae veris - Carpinetum, type of phytocenosis Melica uniflora - Asperula odorata - Dactylis glomerata ssp. polygama /KUBICEK - BRECHTL 197o/. The concrete goal of the research in accordance with the IBP goals was the assessment and numerical expression of the accumulation of nutrients /N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S/ and of ash in the above ground biomass of woody plants in the ecosystem of the Central European hornbeam oak forest. At the same time the flow of the mentioned bioelements in the presipi tation water ^oRether with the dust fall was investigated. Samples of</page><page sequence="3">- 91 - organic material were taken always from the upper, middle arid lower third of the crown and stem. They were divided into bark and wood. From the crown the samples were taken from the following diameter categories in cm: o-l,5 /leaves, bark, wood/, 1,5-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-lo, lo-15 and 15-2o. Precipitation water /dust fall included/ was taken on open area /import of elements into the ecosystem/, under the crown canopy of different tree species and after flow down their stems. The investigated tree species consume least phosphorus and sulphur and most calcium and nitrogene. A middle position has magnesium and potassium. In precipitations on open area, under the canopy and also in water from the stem flow in concordance with the amounts in the tree species low contents of P but also of К were found. The contents of Mg and N are middle, of Ca are high, but the same is with S, which in vegetative organs of plants was assessed, together with P, in minimal amounts. Sulphur is an element imported at present into forest ecosys- tems, as will be shown later, in great quantities from out- side, while the natural need of the plants is minimal. The average value of pH in precipitation water was on open surface /no forest/ 6,57, under the canopy of different tree-species it was 6,oo - 6,49 and in the stem flow the pH ranged from 4,68 to 5,47. The residue on open surface was 195,3 ppm, under the tree canopy 177, о - 184, o ppm and in pre- cipitations in the stem flow of different tree species it was 298, о - 52o,o ppm. In the first place presents the accumulation /stock/ of total and for the plants available forms of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S in the soil in 3o cm earth layer intensively penetrated by roots, in kg/ha.</page><page sequence="4">- 92 - Nutrients: N P К Ca Mg S Accumulation in 3o cm /kg . h a}/ layer of the soil - total amount 58o5 17o3 73878 32972 2322o 155 - easily soluble forms 139 22 385 1161o 1о68 Accumulation in the woody above - ground phytomass So from the total nutrient stock in the soil the greatest amount was found of potassium and calcium, the share of phos- phorus was smaller and that of sulphur very small, only 155 kg/ha. On the other hand from among the easily soluble, physiologically available nutrients the greatest amount is found of calcium and magnesium. For the completeness sake let it be remarked, that the weight of 3o cm layer of earth is 387o t /dried at lo5°C, so without water/, the weight of the humus in it is 116,1 t/ha. The average annual amount of physio- logically available water was 71o t/ha. On the other hand in a 78 year old forest stand in the woody overground part calcium accumulation was the highest /1115 kg/ha/. Its quantities are of another order than those of other bioelements, including nitrogene, which its 286 kg is in the second place among the nutrients. The amount of accumu- lated ash in the above-ground phytomass of tree species is 37ol kg, from which amount 1694 kg comes for macronutrients expressed in elemental form. Further is demonstrated a review of macronutrient cycling between the soil and the forest stand is given. As to its different flows it may be remarked that the annual re- tention expresses the increase of elements, i.e. their annual retention in the annual shoots and an increment- of the phyto- mass in branches and stems. Another component of the cycling, the annual restitution represents the return of nutrients by the leaf fall of the stand forming tree species. The last com- ponent of the biotic cycle is the absorption of the bio- elements, i.e. the sum of the retention and restitution /kg. ha .year" /:</page><page sequence="5">- 93 - Cycling component: N ?

This is valid for the annual productivity of 625o kg of dry matter of marketable phytomass. This means that a forest ecosystem neads for the production of 625o kg wood with bark the mentioned quantities of macronutrients . It is evident that the key element here is N and P. These elements are least contained in the soil, but the forest ecosystem is absorbing them in relatively greatest quantity. In fact, the share of annual absorption by the stand from the amount of easily soluble forms of nutrients in the soil is for N 48 %, for P 34 %, for К 7 % and for Ca, Mg and S about 1 %. The import of bioelements by precipitation waters which penetrate the canopy of the forest towards the surface of the soil in kg/ha annually and further the comparision of the annual absorption and of the import in absolute values /difference in kg/ha/year/ and relative values /share in %/ are as follow: Nutrients: N P К Ca Mg S Import by precipi- tations in kg. ha-1'. year-1: 4o,o o,5 15,5 253,5 22,3 154,5 Difference 1 /kg. ha*"1 .year" 1 / absorption - import: -26,7 -7, о -11, о -»-191,8 +13,3 +15o,l Share in % import/absorption: 6o 7 58 411 248 3434 The comparision of both flows is obvious enough. The positive differences show a surplus of bioelements from the import by precipitations against their annual absorption in the given ecosystem, the negative differences indicate their</page><page sequence="6">- M - relative deficit. The latter may be covered by other resources /soil reserves, decomposition of the litter etc./. In this case there is a deficit in N, P and K. The percentual ex- pression of both flows a potential possibility to cover the absorption of different nutrients by a forest ecosystem form their import by precipitations, this being possible for P by 7 %, for N and К by about 60 %, for Mg, Ca and S several hundred %. Finally we present the total accumulation of nutrients in the aboveground phytomass of the main tree species of the stand during the growth period, i.e. including the elements contained in the green leaves of trees /in kg/ha/: N P К Ca Mg S Total Ash 347 44 182 1182 66 52 1973 3917 This is valid for phytomass 141 t of dry matter. Results given above determine the main characteristics of the ecosystem of Central European hornbeam oak forest. Above all it is its great modesty, especially when compared with neighbouring agrosystems and in spite of the mineral abundance of the edaphotop. The exception of this statement concerns only the luxurious consummation of Ca, which is the prevailing physiologically accessible nutrient in the sorption complexe of the soil and which was in the 78 year old forest stand accumulated at the rate of 12oo kg/ha. Favorable, even in a lower order, is also the absorption of N, which accumu- lated in the woody above-ground component of the forest eco- system nearly at the rate of 35o kg/ha. In a forest ecosystem, as in every open system, there occur also losses of matter and energy. This export flow in a forest represents above all the decrease of energy by logging, this energy has been accumulated in the trees during their growth. In following review the caloric values of 1 t phytomass of stems of investigated tree species in kJ OSZLÁNYI /1977/ and the export of different nutrients from the forest</page><page sequence="7">- 95 ecosystem through the logging of looo kg of wood /conversion to dry matter at 1о5°С/ is given.

It may be added, perhaps, that the comparision of * caloric value with the con- tents of nutrients, indicates a negative correlation. Besides, the nutrients, according to the absorbed quantity, could be devided into three groups, differentiated as to 'order, nto the first group belongs Ca /about lo kg/, then N and partially К /kilograms/ and at last Mg f S + P /tenths of kg/. Very interesting and important results were obtained concerning the mass of the unmerchentable small wood in this country in operational forestry. From the weight of different nutrients accumulated in the above-ground biomass of the trees, 26-76 %, on the average 27-41 % /21-31 % without leaves/ come from the 0-7 cm diameter category of the branches /with leaves/; This it evident that it is very important to leave the thinnest diameter categories of branches in the forest after the logging. With some elements /N, P, K, Mg/ and with some tree species their accumulation may even attain 1/2 - 3/4 of their above-ground mineral mass grown during the life of the tree species. This fact cannot be neglected while pro- tecting the forest ecosystems which compose the most stable element in a landscape. Above all it must be accentuated at the planning of logging operations /е. g. no logging and skidding from the forest of whole trees/ which should be of the kind which leaves the thinnest branches in the forest so as not to extract a great amount of bioelements from the</page><page sequence="8">- 96 - natural cycling but to iet them participate in the r#x:. forest generation in creating and producing timber. To the above given' reviews iet us add some discussion points. In the first place. - the lowland ecosystems of the Central Europe are generally characterized by substantionaily higher import complements than those of the littoral countries. This is true in the first place for Ca, t«ig, 3 and partly also for К and P. The IBP research object Báb has in this direction an exceptional position. It is presumed that in the given case the source of enrichment" is the immediate contact with the . intensively fertilized and cultivated agricultural chernozem area, without the occurence of water surface, moist boggy areas or compact forest tracts. This condition, together with the loess parent soil substrate rich with carbonates, is the source of a very high import of both alca.lic earths, i.e. calcium and magnesium from the neighbouring agroecosvstem. to the ecosystem of hornbeam oakstand. The mentioned phenomenon may be regarded as typical for enclave forest ecosystems in the region of Central European lowlands and hills. A com- parision with foreign, mostly littoral countries shows thas our data are about lo-2o times higher, while the data from Central European more densely afforested regions, or other ecosystems are about 3-4 times lower than in the research object Báb . One may presume, and there is some evidence to support it /e.g. the greatest import of calcium in the rest period, i.e. in the month after the harvest ani without tne protective influence of field vegetation/, that this is the case of transfer of -nutrients from one ecosystem to the other. This indicates that during last millenia the soils of forest eco- systems in similar regions could be enriched on 1 m'~ surface by several tens of kg of Ca /cca loo kg. m ",4:co years V and also of other elements. In a no wash or periodical wash, type of v;ater régime this means an intensive accumulation of cal- cium in the soil.</page><page sequence="9">- З7 - Another typical characteristic of. the investigated eco- system is the simultaneous high contamination by sulphur compounds. As their absorption by vegetation is very low sind so is, also, their immobilization /annual absorption of S in the investigated ecosystem of oak hornbeam forest does not exceed 5 kg/ha/, this means a threat, which could being about even a serious harm and a disruption of balance in forest and field ecosystems in similar regions and this so more as sulphur is imported nearly exclusively in form sulphate anions 304" /conversion S into 30д = S x 3 =154,5 x 3 = 463,5 kg SO^'V ha/year/ . One could with right rise the question about the origin of the sulphur in precipitations. In the first place it must be stated that this may be the manifestation of the industrial background and of the global pollution of the atmosphere. Even if there is no industrial plant in the inter- mediate vicinity, the position of the site eastwards /di- rection of the prevailing winds/ from the industrial, centre and capital of Slovakia - Bratislava, as well as a short distance /average Í5 kg/4 from further sources of exhalations /industry of aitrogen fertilizers, metallurgical plant, pro- duction of plastics/, may explain also this problem.</page></plain_text>
