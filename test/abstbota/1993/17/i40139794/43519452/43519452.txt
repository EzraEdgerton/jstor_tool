Abstract: In recent years several studies have reported on chironomid production. The purpose of my paper is to evaluate the theoretical and practical aspects of the problems associated with the experimental investigations on chironomids, more specifically on Chironomus balatonicus , and to propose some solutions. A definition for biological production was selected from the traditional statements, which served as a basis for my study, then a new approach from cybernetical aspect is suggested. I consider eight tasks which are necessary to understand the importance of a quantitatively dominant species in the life of a water-body; these are the following: 1) Investigation of the complete life cycle under laboratory conditions. 2) Estimation of the production of one generation on the basis of breeding experiments. 3) Determination of the number of generations in a water-body. 4) The possibilities and ways of extrapolation from breeding results. 5) To establish the survival strategy and to estimate the elimination. 6) Estimation of the total production of the species in a water-body. 7) Possibilities for estimating the quantity of consumed nutrients. 8) Quantitative evaluation of the role of chironomids in matter circulation and in the energy budget of a water-body. 1. Introductory notes and fundamentals The purpose of my paper is to point out some problems and difficulties, both theoretical and practical, that I have encountered during my work and to propose some solution. Therefore, I will not follow the traditional principles and practice in my analysis of the production of Chironomus balatonicus in Lake Balaton. There are a number of such papers and books reporting on chironomid production, including a more recent, excellent review by Lindegaard (1989). My work is based on a cybernetic approach to production (see Dévai et al. 1977) which rests on the traditional concept of Balogh (1953) and Mann (1969). I indicate how difficult the interpretation of the results of production biological investigations may be, for any organism, according to its status both in nutrient cycling and in energy flow. It can be viewed in two ways. One approach is environment- centered and the other is organism-centered . Ac- cording to the former, chironomids destruct materials (destructors) and release energy (decomposing organisms), while according to the latter, they convert materials (converters) and transfer energy (reconstitutive organisms). Within the latter group, C. balatonicus can be treated as a recuperator from the aspect of material cycling, and restitutive from the energetic point of view. 2. Motivation and strategy I evaluate the biomass production of C. balato- nicus in this paper according to its role in the nutrient cycling and energy flow of Lake Balaton, i.e. my approach is environment-centered. Natural- ly, such a treatment is supported by preceding or- ganism-centered investigations. In the following sections I survey eight groups of tasks that, I believe, would be necessary to under- stand the production biological significance of a quantitatively dominant species in the ecology of a water body. 3. Results 3.1 Studies on life cycle A homogeneous culture of the studied species was maintained in the laboratory. In this way, the com-</page><page sequence="2">262 Dévai: Production of Chironomus balatonicus plete life cycle of the species, the mean duration of each developmental stage, and the rate and amount of biomass change per individual may be observed and recorded. Direct observations and the microscopic measure- ment of the head capsule show that the duration of each larval stage - under lab conditions - is the following: the first, second and third stages are 3-5 days long, respectively, the fourth lasts 5-10 days. Thus, the complete larval development takes roughly 15-20 days. Supported by a very powerful method in distinguishing the larval stages (see Török 1982), namely, plotting the dry body mass against time, we can draw the growth curves (Fig. 1). These curves show that less than 5 percent of the maximum body mass of the larvae is attained by the end of the second stage. Body mass con- siderably increases only from the third stage on- wards. However, the crucial part of the growth period (over 75 percent) is the final larval stage. The analysis of daily growth data shows that females reach their maximum mass in the 7-8th phase of the fourth stage, whereas males in the Figure 1. Body mass changes in different developmental stages of Chironomus balatonicus according to laboratory breeding. 8th. No increase in body mass was found in the 9th phase just before pupation. Another important finding is that sexes, regarding their developmen- tal trends, segregate sharply from the middle of the fourth stage, and the body mass of females usually exceed that of males by approximately the mass of an egg string. During pupation and emergence a marked decrease in dry body mass was found. This comes from gut emption, shed exuvium, metabolic loss on metamorphosis, and excreted dissimilation products (Gere 1978). The decrease of body mass continues in the adults since they do not feed and thus they cover their energy needs by using reserve nutrients accumulated during the larval stages. In females, egg production causes further con- siderable loss of body mass. 3. 2 Estimating in vitro production The curve showing the body mass change of the larvae and the equation of the fitted curve (Fig. 2) allow us to predict the production at the in- dividual level. We established that the best fit for the body mass growth of C. balatonicus, contrary to earlier findings (see Szokolova 1983), is given by the logistic function, which underlies several important laws for describing biological phenomena. It has been used successfully, for ex- ample, to describe the development of other kinds of organisms (see Sváb 1981). The shape of the curve depends on the actual circumstances, there- fore it is subjected to considerable change. To ex- trapolate the curve, two parameters should be known: the maximum mass of the larvae and the time required to reach this maximum. Then, a growth curve can be constructed and fitted for any generation. Naturally, further difficulties may emerge, especially from the fact that the develop- mental rhythm is influenced by external conditions in addition to the internal features of the animal. External factors include temperature as the most important one, which may shorten the exponential period in the autumn and spring generation, and may extend the same in the first summer genera- tion. This necessitates some corrections that should be considered in experimental design and during the evaluation of results. 3.3 The number of generations The number of generations developed in a given water body per year, as well as the number of adults (emerging animals) per generation should be established by census at least every other week. These observations are especially important where</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 263 several, perhaps overlapping generations occur, as it was reported earlier in case of C. balatonicus (Dévai 1990). 3.4 Extrapolation from breeding results The investigations suggested above enable us to describe the course of development shown by the larvae of a particular species, the number of generations in a given water body in a given year, and the life span of each generation. Thus, we can extrapolate the body mass growth curve, based on laboratory breeding, to each natural generation. By the curve and the fitted function of larval production it can be estimated in any detail. 3.5 Survival strategy and elimination The number of individuals in each developmental stage and the type of their frequency distribution should be determined through appropriate sam- pling. The analysis should rely on the number of larvae belonging to different body length classes. Our results suggest that C. balatonicus belongs to the survival strategy type characterized by a decrease of survivors, best approximated by the 1/X hyperbolic function (Fig. 3). The distribution, the fitted curves, and the fitted function provide a basis for the estimation of elimination and, in turn, production. 3.6 Estimating the production in a given water body At this stage, calculations are based on the num- ber of individuals entering pupation and the cor- responding degree of elimination. In this way, biomass production can be determined for each generation, as well as for the entire growing season or the whole year. 3. 7 Estimation of nutrient consumption With the above facts at hand we can begin to quantify the larval nutrient intake and, therefore, to evaluate the importance of a population in nutrient cycling. For C. balatonicus , this procedure is as follows. According to published data (see Tudorancea et al. 1979, Szokolova et al. 1983) the assimilation ef- Figure 2.

However, in light of some recent studiep (see e.g. Cressa &amp; Lewis 1986) and the results of Török (1982) the difference between the suggested AE values, ratios of respiration and metabolic loss ap- pear somewhat exaggerated. Therefore, we con- sidered the mean of the two extremes to draw up the nutrient budget of Lake Balaton (specifically, AE=0.70; the P:R:(F+U) ratio being 33.5:36.5:30; growth efficiency coefficients are: Ki=0.33, K2=0.48). These values are far more consistent with the general rules of dietary physiology (see Lloyd et al. 1978). On the basis of these data, together with the num- ber of individuals and the organic carbon content of the sediment (see Dévai et al. 1984) we could reveal the importance of chironomids in reducing the organic material content of the sediment. In Lake Balaton, these figures appeared especially significant during the autumn and spring periods in 1983, since both the number of the larvae and their food consumption were relatively high at that time. The number of larvae per site in March, 1983, was averaged and weighted with a factor representing the area of the constituent basins. Figure 3.

The survival curve of Chironomus balatonicus larvae based on the relative frequency of the body length classes of the living individuals in the same generation. The mean number of C. balatonicus larvae was 2414 per m2; they consumed 2x10s tons of organic material in wet mass that equals 4xl04 tons in terms of dry mass. Although the number of in- dividuals in each of the three summer generations (799, 883, 196, respectively) was far behind the spring and autumn ones, together (1978 ind. per m2) they showed a marked activity by consuming 1x10s tons of organic material in wet mass (2x10 tons in dry mass). 3.8 Drawing up the energy budget of a water body If our concern goes beyond the processes within a given water body and we want to include the ef- fects of emergence, some information on emer- gence dynamics is required. For C. balatonicus, this was presented in an earlier paper (Dévai 1988). With full knowledge of the dynamics of the emer- gence and the body mass changes during the pupal stage and later in the adult (see 3.1 or Dévai 1980), one can begin to draw up the overall energy budget. For Lake Balaton, this was published ear- lier (Dévai 1990). Acknowledgements.
