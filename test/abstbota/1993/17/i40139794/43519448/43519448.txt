Abstract: A physical-topological model of the Fibonacci plant symmetries was described and developed from many aspects by the author earlier. The cell-mosaic frame of reference determines the topological characteristics of both the global and the local versions of the model and its hierarchical generalization. The model construction starts with transformations of topological type in order to normalize different Fibonacci plant structures to their cell-mosaic-lattice representatives on a cylinder. Then Fibonacci plant structure representatives are arranged into a sequence according to their band systems determined by the growing pairs of neighbour Fibonacci numbers. Reading the sequence of normalized Fibonacci cell-mosaic structures into a transformational chain starting from the simplest (and most symmetric) 1+1 band mosaic to cell-mosaics with higher and higher pairs of Fibonacci numbers we get both a developmental and and evolutionary path for this class of structures and a cellular automaton description of its operation, which also has topological character. 1. Definition Fibonacci plants are plants that have globally cylindrically symmetric organs (subsystems), where the surface lattice system of repeating con- gruent (or similar) units: elements ("cells") form bands, and the numbers of these bands winding to the left and to the right are two neighbour Fibonacci numbers (Fig. 1). 2. Program The cell-mosaic system or the point-lattice system in the different appearances of the phenomenon both suggest a frame of reference to be fixed to the lattice elements. Lattice elements can be named: their names are cardinal numbers according to their heights on the stem or organ, which has cylindrical axis perpendicular to the water-level. First we normalize the different appearances of the phenomenon (Fig. 2). Then we form an evolu- tionary sequence from the normalized representa- tives according to their increasing pairs of Fibonacci numbers. We may call the next step: reading the sequence to a cell-mosaic-automata process. Reading means: comparison of the neigh- bour representatives according to their right and left band systems. Comparison of results in the recognition of the generator operation, which deduces structures with higher Fibonacci numbers from their neighbour with one step lower pairs of Fibonacci numbers. Discrete, step-by-step opera- tion is the connector of the structures, which leads, on the other hand, to an irreducible struc- ture of the sequence. This irreducible structure is the simplest structure in the sequence: it has mir- ror symmetry. Then we formulate the operation in a cellular automaton form, i.e. in the form of in-</page><page sequence="2">226 Bérczi: Cellular automatic transformations Figure 1. General characteristics of Fibonacci plant struc- tures on the level of different plant individuals are the fol- lowing: a. global rotational (cylindrical) symmetry, b. constant angle of meridional crossing of edges of cell- mosaic-lattice lines, c. both cylindrical and discoidal ap- pearance, d. two opposite winding band-systems characterized by pairs of neighbour Fibonacci numbers of their band-widths. structions for the individual cells. (This is the solution of the indirect von Neumann problem.) 3. Normalization Organs of Fibonacci plants, where the Fibonacci structures occur, are different in rotational surface forms and repeating unit ("celi") forms, too. For comparisons we must transform them into a nor- malized cell form and surface. The normalized form of cells will be the square, the normalized surface will be the cylinder. The size of the square and that of the cylinder (i.e. diameter, for in- stance) are connected through the number of bands in the Fibonacci structure (Figure 6). First of all we transform the botanical Fibonacci phyllotaxis to a corresponding cell-mosaic struc- ture (Fig. 4). The Dirichlet-Voronoy transforma- tion is a suitable method to accomplish this correspondence between the two variants of the Fibonacci structure. (In phyllotaxis the dot system of branchings on a stem form a pattern of small regions, Figure 2a.) In the Dirichlet-Voronoy transformation cells are formed around dots (Fig. S) by drawing the lines halfway and perpendicular Figure 2.

The analytical way of mapping between discoidal appearance of Fibonacci structure and the nor- malized forms can be shown as follows *Fig. 3). The mapping will be given for the border lines of the great sunflower ( Helianthus annuus) to a planar region, which should be rolled to form the normalized form of this Fibonacci structure. A planar logarithmic spiral band system with two different enlargement parameters, and widths with two neighbour Fibonacci numbers are the main characteristics of this pattern. The equation of logarithmic spiral (bordering) curves of the one direction bands is:</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 227 (*&gt; + /l8 a r = e where r and &lt;p are the polar coordinates, a is the enlargement parameter (the angle between the radius vector and the tangent to the curve at any point). In a transformed form the earlier equation is: &lt;p = (tga) In r - k2II/Fi where k = 0, 1, F|-l; and Fi is the Fibonacci number of the bands on this direction. Similarly, the equation of the bordering curves (with enlar- gement parameter ß) in the other direction can be written: -&lt;p = (tg /J) In r - 1 2II/F2 where 1 = 0, 1, ..., F2-I; and F2 is the Fibonacci number of bands in this direction. Mapping the two systems of logarithmic spirals to the borders of the square cell-lattice system we relate the first bundle of spirals to the band borders between lines of the plane given by y = k 211/Fi where k = 0,1,..., Fi; line equations in the cartesian coor- dinate system; and we relate the second bundle of spirals to the lines: x= 1 2II/F2 where 1 = 0, 1,...,F2 (Figure 3). 4. Construction of the topological model Some preliminary results in the preparations of model-construction have been summarized in Figure 3. Two bundle systems of logarithmic spiral curves define the borders of the two band systems of Fibonacci plants in a discoidal development (for example: ( Helian - thus annuus). Definitions of symbols are given in the text Figure 4. Botanical representation of the Fibonacci phyl- lotaxis of the right winding cauline plants. The symbols mean the direction of motion in fraction of the circum- ference of the stem from a dot to its higher neighbour along a screw line (helix) shown upper right. Left column of the four most simple cases shows this structure of representations so that smaller circles mean upper posi- tions. Figure 6. According to this figure normalized representatives of Fibonacci plant structures form a sequence in the order of increasing pairs of Fibonacci numbers characteristic to their band structure. Our basic conception in model-construction is that this sequence represents the path of the development of the Fibonacci structure. In order to "animate" this sequence we consider the ele- ments of the sequence as stages of the state-chan- ges of a cylindrical cell-mosaic system. The state changes are transformations of the initial struc- ture. Initial structure is the simplest and the most symmetric structure - the 1+1 band system with mirror symmetry • from which an operation trans- forms the cell-system to the structures with higher Fibonacci numbers in their bands. In order to find this operation (as a consequence of the topologi- cal model preparations) we compare band struc-</page><page sequence="4">228 Bérczi: Cellular automatic transformations Figure 5. Normalization of Fibonacci phyllotans on cauline plants needs two transformations. A-»B. Dirichlet-Voronoy cells of the original stem are elongated hexagons. A-»C. The transformation, which maps the original dot structure to the normalized cell-mosaic (i. e. squares) structure is a topological transformation in two steps: it first distorts the stem by axial shrinking then uses Dirichlet-Voronoy transformation: cells on the shrunken stem will be squares. Normalized cases of Figure 4 are shown in Figure 6. tures which are neighbours in the sequence. In Figure 7 the normalized Fibonacci structures were separated to their two band system components and these were arranged one above the other as a continuation of Figure 6. Comparing bands of equal width, one above the other (connected by brackets) we can see that they are different in relation to the position of the con- situent part-bands. Part-bands in any lower Fibonacci structure are displaced one lattice unit (or cell unit) in one direction if we compare them to part-bands of the upper Fibonacci structure. On the basis of this recognition we can construct an operation which "animates": connects and deduces Fibonacci structures from the initial 1+1 structure. This operation is: part-band sliding (dis- placement) one which should be used alternately in the two lattice directions (Figure 8). It is a con- equence of the operation that cylinder diameter ¿rows under the construction of the sequence (Figure 6). It is another important consequence of our model that the operation needs a mirror symmetric ini- tial condition. This fact connects symmetrical and topological characteristics being present in the Fibonacci cell-mosaic structure. We can conclude that owing to the normalization which used topological transformations, the implications of both mirror symmetry and the alternating part- band sliding operation in our model-construction are also topological invariants of the structure. However, the Fibonacci structure is also in direct logical relation to the mirror symmetric initial condition in another, visible sense. At the first step of the sliding operation, the initial mirror symmetry is violated. This way two enantiomor- phic families of Fibonacci plants may begin to develop. Development of the two families in the same population (see e.g. Maróti, 1980) can exist only if the organisms start from a mirror sym- metric initial arrangement and physical parameters later decide which of them will grow up to the right and which to the left family of enantiomorphy (Figure 9). We can conclude that mirror symmetry is an in- direct topological property of Fibonacci plants in two aspects. First, it is hidden in Fibonacci num- bers; second, it is expressed in enantiomorphy. 5. The cell-mosaic-automata model of the Fibonacci structure In the previous sections transformations of the cellmosaic systems of the Fibonacci structures were carried out by a global - i.e. the part-band sliding - operation. Owing to the topological na- ture of both operations in normalization, and the cell-unit-discplacement phenomenon (the basic event in construction of the global operation), it is plausible to transcribe our model into a local type cellular automaton structure, step by step, simulating the growing plant structure. This transcription sholuld emphasize the local effects of the global generator operation and strenghten the topological aspects of the model. Although locality was important in normalization, the Dirichlet-Voronoy transformation surpassed it in some respects! This transformation enlarges the place of activity around branching nodes on a stem in order to make cellular pattern from a dot sys-</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 229 Figure 6. The final products of normalization are: band systems with square cell-mosaic elements cut, skinned, doubled (in order to show both left and right band-structure) and spread out from the cylinder to the plane. The four simplest cases are arranged here from top to bottom according to their increasing pairs of Fibonacci numbers. (Renormalized blocks are shown for cylinder-diameter determination.)</page><page sequence="6">230 Bérczi: Cellular automatic transformations Figure 7. Comparison of separated and sequentially arranged band systems of different Fibonacci structures makes it possible to recognize the operation: the part-band sliding, which - using it alternately - connects all Fibonacci structures. Bands with equal width (and winding direction) of two neighbouring Fibonacci structures (here connected by brackets) exhibit both the one-cell-unit translational difference between the positions of part-bands and the alternating ap- pearance of this part-band displacement phenomenon. Normalized representations of Fibonacci structures were given on Figure 6. with their doubled band-systems. Either the bands winding to the left or the bands winding to the right are enough to recontstruct mosaic structures on cylinder. tem. But this enlargement projects any events in the cell region onto the borders, so makes the model insensitive for events wich happen in higher resolution pattern. Nevertheless, the transcription of bur global model of development of the Fibonacci structure to a cellular automata model will focus our attention on the role of local in- fluences in this type of pattern formation. In a cellular automaton model uniform cells are arranged in a regular mosaic thus forming a cell- mosaic-background for the events. Initial condi- tions, i.e. the initial state of the cells must be</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 231 Figure 8. Reconstruction of the development of Fibonacci structure in the alternating, discrete, global operation of part- band sliding. In our model gradual symmetry transformations comprehend all Fibonacci structures. The hypothetical process begins at the mirror symmetric initial condition. The mirror symmetry of the 1+ 1 band-system is violated at the first step of operation: cell element 1 (and its band) slides one unit to the right. This sliding generates two bands to the left direction. Further steps of alternating part-band sliding operation build up (so "animate") the whole sequence of the normalized Fibonacci structures, which belong to the Fibonacci phyllotaxis of the right winding family. The enantiomor- phous pair of this family can be generated by the violation of the initial mirror symmetry of 1+ 1 band system into the other direction (Figure 9).</page><page sequence="8">232 Bérczi: Cellular automatic transformations Figure 9. Mirror symmetry is a property of the 3D space. Fibonacci structures are embedded into this space and " remem- ber " initial mirror symmetry in Fibonacci numbers of their band systems; and preserve it in enantiomorphy. The system, which exhibits both phenomena in a single structure is the 1+ 1 band system (the representation of the wheat-ear struc- ture). In our model-construction with topological roots the violation of tne initial mirror symmetry (which is inherent with the initial structure) happens at the first step of the operation which starts to build up larger, more densely popu- lated Fibonacci structures by the alternately used part-band sliding. given. State changes of the cells happen in paral- lel, discrete steps according to a local transitional function which is uniform for all cells. Local steps are summing up step by step to form a global tran- sitional function, which represents the state chan- ges of the cell-mosaic-background (Fig. 10). 6. Cellular automaton framework The cellular automaton model has a characteristic framework of description. It is composed of two parts of conditions. The first one gives the struc- ture of the cellular background, the second one gives the transitional functions. Both parts of con- ditions form a pair of approach: a local and a global one, as given in Table 1. 7. The indirect von Neumann problem The classical way of the development of a cellular automaton model was the construction of Aa and Ab background and the Ba local transitional func- tion, at first. Then followed the deduction of the global transitional function Bb, which holds the primary goal of the construction. We may call this way of model construction the direct way.

Our way of construction in this paper is the in- direct way in respect of von Neumann's direction of construction (von Neumann, 1966.) After stretching the background by the determination of points of Aa and Ab we formulate the Bb global transitional function as a sequence of stages of dis- crete steps of transformations of the cell-mosaic system; and finally we construct the Ba local tran- sitional function for the cells themselves (Fig. 10). The indirect von Neumann problem was formu- lated and used as a framework in the description of transformations of regular surface and space mosaics (Bérczi 1980). Although the first model of symmetry by cellular automata was constructed for the Fibonacci structures in 1985 (by the author, Figure 12), the preliminary model (1976) also had used global transitional functions in the descrip- tion of local (cell-mosaic) transformations of these structures. (Another implicit formulation and solution of the indirect von Neumann problem were given in Bérczi (1978) for Platonic- Archimedean Spherical Cellular Automata; trun- cation of a 3D cubic tesselation.) Let us consider the sequence of the normalized representations of Fibonacci structures to be the stages of a global transition function of a cell- mosaic-automata backround on a cylinder. Our program is to transcibe the global transition func- tion into a local transition function; i.e. to instruc- tions for the cells (Fig. 12). The transition function will be an operation which changes the neighbours of any cell in a uniform way. There will be two kinds of transitions, one after the other; ac- cording to the alternation of the part-band sliding</page><page sequence="10">234 Bérrai: Cellular automatic transformations SPECIFICATIONS IN THE CELLULAR AUTOMATON MODEL BACKGROUND TRANSITIONAL FUNCTIONS Aa LOCAL Ab GLOBAL Ba LOCAL Bb GLOBAL THE NETWORK INVARIANT li UJ g 2 ļļ] (MOSAIC) AND PROPERTIES ^ UJ cc Ž Is Iii SHAPE OF 1&gt;£ OF SURFACE &gt;r W j * CELLS ^ SPECIFICATIONS SPECIFICATIONS Z in ,5 OF THE INITIAL OF THE INITIAL m 2 0 t Q VALUES OF CELL PARAMETERS S R 0 1 R 0 STATES OF THE NETWORK p SPECIFICATIONS 2 tr o OF THE TYPE OF I- UJ _ ii_ § 5 THE SURFACE ii_ ° 8 5 § 8 Z 8 (TOPOLOGY) O £ DETERMINED BY DETERMINED BY 5 * ~ £ RETURNING NEIGHBOURHOOD 8 ° &lt; S 3 ° &lt; Q ^ § BANDS OF CELLS EFFECTS OF - S I Di ON THE SURFACE CELLS 2r 2 TRANSITIONS OF TRANSITIONS OF ¿ z § STATES OF CELIS THE WHOLE SUR- S S z S g § § DEPEND ON CELL FACE SUMMED UP ° So INTERACTIONS FROM CELL-TRANS.

These two steps of the local transition function are described both in Fig. 12 and in the summariz- ing table of Figure 13. It is important to notice that both the screen and the operations are different for a planar and a cylindrical cell-mosaic automaton. Figure 11 shows that in the planar case all the screen may be populated but the model is effective only for the cells on the bands. A hypothetical cylindrical cell- mosaic screen does not need such a superfluous condition. Cylindrical screen should change its diameter, as a consequence of the rearrangement of the structure, step by step, simulating the grow- ing plant structure (Fig. 6). 8. Summary In our paper a model was constructed to describe a hypothetical development of the Fibonacci plant structures. The model emphasized the strong con- nection between the role of symmetry (initial con- dition, border condition = cylinder) and topology (in normalization, in operations - both global and local - which deform the structure) in the struc- ture of Fibonacci plants. The global, but even more the local, cell-mosaic-automaton model showed that the Fibonacci numbers are quantities</page><page sequence="14">238 Bérczi: Cellular automatic transformations Figure 14. Hexagonal representation of the model construction given in the paper shows that Fibonacci structure does not depend on the form of lattice elements (cells) which build up the pattern. Hexagonal representation makes it pos- sible to show the Fibonacci numbered bands in three directions. This figure confirms the conclusion that Fibonacci numbers are invariants of the uniform construction: a. on the cylinder (topology) b. with mirror symmetric initial condi- tion (symmetry constraint). of bands as topological invariants because of both the uniform band or cell operations (depending on the model) and lattice structure on the cylinder. On the other hand, the model proved that Fibonacci numbers represent the "remember- ing" of the structure to its initial mirror symmetric condition (Fig. 14). Summarizing the two conse- quences we can conclude that Fibonacci numbers are both symmetric and topologie invariants of the most simple lattice structure family on the cylinder. 9.
