Abstract: The relationship between climatic ordinations and the geographic position of meteorological stations has been studied via Procrustes analysis in order to measure the effects of some geographic features on climatic variation within phytoclimatic zones of China. The analysis showed that for nearly all phytoclimatic zones there is a high correspondence between the position of the metereological stations in multidimensional climatic space and in the territory. This means that the climatic variation follows a regular pattern in the territories of phytoclimatic zones. However, multiple regression confirmed that Procrustes measures of dissimilarity within each zone are significantly correlated with the standard deviation of altitude and the number of rivers of that zone. This indicates that these two geographic features affect the pattern of climatic variation. Introduction Climatic data collected worldwide by meteo- rological stations are often used to create phyto- climatic classifications (Holdrige 1947, Walter &amp; Lieth 1967). These classifications are based on the assumption that climate is the dominating factor in controlling vegetation variation. This looks true at large-scale: in an extensive multivariate study Sun &amp; Feoli (1991) have found that climate by itself is responsible for more than 60% of the differences between the major vegetation types of China. Phytoclimatic classes obtained by clas- sification of vegetation types based on climatic data may be used to subdivide a territory into phytoclimatic zones. The climatic variation within a given geographical area and within each of its phytoclimatic zones may be affected by latitude, longitude and altitude as well as by other geo- graphic features such as presence of mountains and rivers. It is expected that the high correspon- dence between the geographic position (latitude, longitude and altitude) and the position of the meteorological stations in multidimensional cli- matic space should be veiy high if the landscape would vary very regularly. On the other hand, low correspondence would mean that the landscape is heterogeneous and that climatic predictions would be very difficult if based merely on latitudinal - longitudinal - altitudinal data. Pro- crustes analysis provides measures of correspon- dence between the geographic position of the stations and their position in multidimensional climatic space, while multiple regression analysis provides measures quantifying how much land- scape heterogeneity may influence the climatic pattern and therefore vegetation pattern within phytoclimatic zones. The present paper inves- tigates within the Chinese territory the correspon- dence between the climatic ordination of meteo-</page><page sequence="2">142 Feoli, Podaní &amp; Sun: Phytoclimatic ordinations rological stations and their geographic position in order to measure the predictability of climate with respect to vegetation within phytoclimatic zones. Material and methods Data and. previous analyses Although a more detailed account is given in Sun and Feoli (1991), it is necessary here to give a brief summary of data and some earlier results, because they provide the starting point for this study. The basic data set comprises meteorological ob- servations for 106 climatic variables measured from 1951 to 1980 at 644 stations all around China. Based on these observations, a 644 by 106 data matrix of average monthly values was created. The application of sum of squares rank- ing (Orlóci 1973) reduced the number of variables to 10, with 94% efficiency. The 644 by 10 data matrix is used in this paper to generate ordina- tions of stations. The 644 sites were assigned to each of the 23 main vegetation types currently recognized in China (Chang 1988). By selecting a random seed station from each vegetation type, iterative nonhierarchi- cal clustering (Anderberg 1973) was performed based on the 106 original climatic variables, in order to define the 23-climatic clusters. The resulting clusters were further subjected to in- cremental sum of squares clustering, and 8 major groups were identified from the resulting dendrogram. These groups largely correspond to the eight vegetation zones suggested by Chang (1988) for China. In the sequel, these eight groups will be referred to as phytoclimatic zones (see Table 1, for names and the numbers of stations in- cluded (N) and Figure 1 for the geographic dis- tribution of these zones). The landscape heterogeneity of each phytocli- matic zone was expressed in terms of the standard deviation of elevation (SDE) and the number of river branches (NR). The first variable clearly shows if there are excessive elevation differences among stations, whereas the other reflects geo- morphological diversity in a rough way. Figure 1.

Procrustes analyses This method introduced by Schönemann &amp; Car- roll (1970) and Gower (1971) allows the com- parison of configurations of m points in n-di- mensional spaces represented by n x m matrices. Two such matrices, X and Y could be compared by the sum of squared positional differences given by m n 2 2 (xu - y¡j&gt;2 = tr (x - v)- (x - Y) ¡»i j=i Since there is no preferred position and orienta- tion of the configurations of points in ordination scattergrams, ordination scores can be considered arbitrary. We can move the points in Y relative to X through rotation, reflection and translation to optimize the goodness of fit of Y to X. The first step is the centring of X and Y so that both sets of points have their centroid at the orgin (for con- venience, X and Y will denote centered matrices in the sequel). The required rotation of Y is ob- tained by its multiplication with the n x n or- thogonal transformation matrix H = VU' where U and V result from the singular value decomposition of X'Y = USV After finding these matrices, the goodness of fit statistics will be computed as Re2 = tr(X-YH)'(X-YH) = = tr (XX') + tr (YV) - 2 tr (YX'XY')172 which is a symmetric measure. Re2 depends on the actual scales of X and Y, therefore this statistic is not appropriate for arbitrarily scaled ordina- tions. Inclusion of a scaling parameter c in the transformation of Y to cYH resolves this problem c = trCYHX'ytrOV) leading to RS2 = tr (XX') - 2 (tr (YX'XY')1/2)2 / tr^V) This coefficient is unsymmetric, therefore Gower (1971) suggested to scale each configuration after centering, so that tr(XX') = tr(YY) = 1 to yield a coefficient denoted by d2. As Sibson (1978) pointed out, Rs2 may be standardized directly ys = Rs2/tr (XX') resulting a range between 0 and 1, and there is a simple relationship between this and Gower's measure d2 = 2(1 - (i-n)1/2&gt; Then it becomes clear that d2 ranges from zero to 2, but this simple fact is not mentioned in most texts. Procrustes analysis was used here for the com- parison of the PCA ordinations with the actual geographical positions of the stations. All subsets of the PCA scores and the geographical coor- dinates were normalized to unit sum of squares from the respective centroids in order to obtain a symmetric measure of distance between the con- figurations (Digby &amp; Kempton 1987). The dis- tance is expressed as the sum of squared distances (denoted by d2) between the corresponding points of the two ordinations such that the point con- figurations are fitted to each other as perfectly as possible. Two series of analyses were made. In the first, the scores on PCA axes 1 and 2 were con- trasted with the first two geographical variables, i.e., latitude and longitude. The second series of analyses used three PCA dimensions and three geographical variables, latitude, longitude and elevation above sea level (altitude). The assessment of how closely PCA ordinations reflect the geographical positions requires com- parison of resulting scores. Even though the theoretical upper limit of d2 is 2, regardless the number of dimensions and points, the absolute d2 measures derived from Procrustes analyses involv- ing different numbers of points and dimensions are not comparable directly. As Podani (1991a) pointed out, a value of d2=.99, for example, for 10 points does not indicate closer relationships bet- ween the respective configurations than, say, a score of 1.00 for 100 points. The reason is that these two values are not equally likely for ran- domly generated ordinations under different cir- cumstances. A more meaningful approach is thus to consider random expectations and probability</page><page sequence="4">144 Feoli, Podáni &amp; Sun: Phytoclimatic ordinations distributions, estimated by Monte Carlo simula- tion (Podani 1991a). As a measure of ordination dissimilarity, the actual d2 value divided by the random expectation is used, Ò 2 = d2/(E(d2)) so that measures derived from situations with dif- ferent numbers of points and/or dimensions will become directly comparable. The simulated fre- quency distributions facilitate assessment of the significance of ordination dissimilarity. In this study, for each combination of the number of points and dimensions, 1000 pairs of random or- dinations were simulated to estimate the expected values and probabilities. Regression and correlation In order to obtain a rough estimate on the relationships between the ò2 values and landscape heterogeneity, multiple regression analysis was performed between ò 2 as dependent variable and SDE, NR and AREA as independent variables. Product moment correlation coefficient was also calculated between ò 2 and such variables. Computer programs Principal components analyses were performed using program PRINCOMP, whereas Procrustes comparisons were done by a modified version of program PRANA, both programs are included in the SYN-TAX IV package (Podani 1991b). The random number generator routine used in the simulations was taken from Park and Miller (19 88). The number of river branches was calcu- lated from the vegetation map of China and the estimation of surface area of phytoclimatic zones was performed by the Map II geographical data processing system (Kirby et al. 1989). Multiple regression and the correlations were calculated using program SPSS (Nie et al. 1975). Computa- tions were carried out on a Macintosh Ilfx com- puter of HEM and the Vax mainframe of the computer center of University of Trieste. Results and discussion The 9 ordination scattergrams are not shown here. Instead, we present the percentages ex- plained by components in Table 1.

The symbol &lt;.001 in the tables means that the actual d2 was lower than the simulated mini- mum. This is the most common outcome showing that, in general, ordinations based on climatic in- formation agree very well with the geographical positions of stations. The "worst" case is the warm temperate zone for 2 dimensions, because the value of 1.543 can come from random ordinations at the conventional .05 probability level. The correspondence between ordinations and geographical data is better in 2 dimensions than in 3 for three zones: cold-temperate, alpine grass- land and temperate desert.

By looking at Table 4, which shows the ¿summary of the Procrustes measurements in 2 and 3 dimensions and geomorphological features, we see that these zones have relatively low density of rivers and relatively low values of the coefficient of variation for elevation (CV). For the other 4 zones, there is a considerable improvement of or- dination similarity by adding the third dimension suggesting that for these zones, elevation has im- portant effects on climate. The correlation between the variables in Table 4 is shown in Table 5. Ô2 (in 3 dimensions) is sig- nificantly correlated with AREA and NR. Ô2 (in 2 dimensions) has always lower correlation with the other variables. The multiple regression results prove that the value of ô 2 is very sensitive to landscape heterogeneity. In the three dimensional case, ô?is significantly correlated with NR and if we add either SDE or AREA, the multiple correlation al- ways increases significantly (from 0.76 to 0.90). In two dimensions, the single correlation between the Ò2 value and any other variables is not very</page><page sequence="6">146 Feoli, Podáni &amp; Sun: Phytoclimatic ordinations high. However, if we consider NR with SDE and AREA in multiple regression, the multiple cor- relation coefficient increases to 0.93. Conclusions Procrustes analysis proves that there is a strong correlation between the geographical position and climate within the phytoclimatic zones of China and for the whole country. This method can be used to test the effects of landscape hete- rogeneity with respect to climatic variation. The ò2 values, as a measurement of ordination dis- similarity, can be used to measure the predict- ability of geographical position on climate and therefore on vegetation. If the d2 value is high, it means that the climatic trends are not very well reflected by geographical position and thus for predicting the vegetation pattern we need to com- bine the geographical data with climatic data.
