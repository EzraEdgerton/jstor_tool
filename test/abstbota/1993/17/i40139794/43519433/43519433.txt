Abstract: Estimates of mean values of forest, grassland or other vegetation resources may be obtained with greater precision than other common sampling techniques by using ranked set sampling (RSS). This works by maintaining the unbiasedness of random sampling while increasing the chances of representing the full range of the underlying population by capitalizing on expert judgment or quantitative information about the population at the sample level. Precision of an RSS estimator will always be greater than or equal to that of a simple random sample estimator and will be greater than an estimator from double sampling for regression in many realistic situations. Methods and case studies are presented here along with theoretical considerations of the various factors affecting relative precision and a discussion of future directions. 1. Introduction Sampling vegetation consists of three main steps: 1) identification of sample units; 2) selection of particular units for quantification; and 3) quan- tifying the characteristic of interest. Identifying sample units is typically simple, such as outlining a quadrat or locating a tree, while actual quan- tification is the time consuming task, such as cut- ting, drying and weighing herbage. The intermediate step of selecting particular sample units can, however, be exploited to yield a more efficient sample. Increased efficiency means that more information is contained in a sample of a given size, as reflected by decreased variance of an estimator. Often the sampling units can be ranked by simple visual inspection according to the characteristic of interest prior to actual quantification. When visual inspection is not feasible, ranking can sometimes be done based on a covariate that is correlated with the characteristic of interest. For example, if we are interested in the volume of trees, we may use ranking by diameter at breast height to approximate ranking by volume. On a larger scale, remote sensing data may provide valuable information. For such situations where preliminary ranking of the sample units is feasible, Mclntyre (1952) developed the method of ranked set sampling (RSS) to improve upon simple random sampling (SRS) for estimating mean pasture yields. Mclntyre's goal was to maintain the unbiasedness of SRS while incorporating expert judgment into the estimators. Basically, the identified sampling units are randomly partitioned into small sets, then ranked within each set according to the characteristic of interest.. Based on the ranking, exactly one member of each set is then chosen for quantification. Even in the presence of ranking 1 The paper has been prepared with partial support from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Number CR-815273.

Apparently, Mclntyre's proposal was not fully recognized until over a decade later, when resear- chers showed empirically that RSS yielded more efficient estimators of mean forage yields in a pine-hardwood forest (Halls and Dell 1966) and mean number of Longleaf Pine seedlings per milacre plot (Evans 1967). The mathematical foundation for RSS was then established by Takahasi and Wakimoto (1968) and Dell (1969). Since a potentially major source of error is judgmental ranking, Dell and Clutter (1972) con- sidered this effect on RSS. They have shown that, regardless of ranking errors, the RSS estimator of a population mean is unbiased and is at least as efficient as the SRS estimator using the same number of quantifications. Dell and Clutter also emphasized that precision of the RSS estimator, relative to that of the SRS estimator, depends on characteristics of the underlying population as well as the magnitude of ranking errors. In addition to ranking errors, Ridout and Cobby (1987) point out that non-random grouping in sets is another source of error. This situation arises when, for convenience or ease of ranking, the members of each set are spatially proximate or otherwise clustered. The effect of such intraclass correlation had been studied earlier by Takahasi (1969). For the situation where ranking is done by a numerical covariate instead of judgment, David and Levine (1972) obtained a formula expressing the relative precision (RP) of RSS as a function of the squared correlation coefficient between the covariate and the variate of interest. This model has been further explored by Stokes (1976, 1977). When discussing the measurement of grassland vegetation, Mannetje (1978) observes that while the most suitable sampling method depends on many factors, RSS can improve sampling efficien- cy in most circumstances. While emphasizing the unbiasedness of RSS, Mclntyre (1978) points out that RSS can give "worthwhile gain for little extra effort". He further notes that the method could be employed most effectively to improve the es- timates of strata means in the presence of gradients within the plots. For estimating shrub phytomass in forest stands, Martin et al. (1980) report that RSS is better than SRS in both actual and simulated trials. Discuss- ing sward measurement, Jewiss (1981) demon- strates the suitability of RSS for situations when there are substantial changes in the botanical composition of herbage within a plot. The ap- plicability of RSS for estimating herbage mass and clover content in grazed swards has also been ex- amined by Cobby et al. (1985). Most of the studies thus mentioned have been concerned with estimating the population mean. Stokes (1980), meanwhile, has proposed an es- timator of the population variance based on RSS, where she shows that the estimator is asymptoti- cally unbiased even in the presence of ranking error. Stokes (1986) further presented a useful review of some theoretical aspects of RSS. More recently, Stokes and Sager (1988) show that the empirical distribution function of a RSS is un- biased and has greater precision than that from a SRS. 2. Methods of ranked set sampling Selecting a ranked set sample is done by identify- ing m2 sampling units, then randomly partitioning this set into m samples, each consisting of m units. Next, the units within each sample are ranked by visual inspection or some other simple method not requiring actual measurement of the charac- teristic of interest. The units then selected for quantification include the smallest ranked unit from the first sample, the second smallest ranked unit from the second sample and so on until the largest ranked unit is selected from the mth sample. Subsequently, m units are selected for quantification out of m2 units originally iden- tified. While m is a design parameter to be chosen by the researcher, it is best to be kept small, such as 3 or 4, in order to minimize subjective ranking error. To provide a sufficient sample size, the en- tire process (or cycle) can be repeated r times, thus yielding rm quantified units out of rm2 originally identified units. These n=rm units con- stitute the ranked set sample. As an illustration, consider the set size m=3 with r=4 cycles. This situation is depicted in the fol- lowing diagram where each row denotes a judg- ment-ordered sample within a cycle, and the units selected for quantification are circled. Although 36 units have been randomly drawn in 4 cycles, only 12 units are quantified to obtain the ranked set sample.</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 89 rank cycle 12 3 O 1 O G O 2 O O o 3 O Q O 4 O o For one cycle, values for the randomly drawn units, Xij, can be arranged as follows: Set 1 Xn Xl2 ... Xlm 2 X21 X22 ... X2m OS Xml Xm2 ••• Xtntn After ranking the units appear as shown below: Set 1 Xi(i) Xi(2) ... Xi(m) 2 X2(l) X2(2) ... X2(o) m Xm(l) Xm(2) ... Xm(io) where X¡(j) denotes the order statistic of the jth unit in the ith set. The diagonal elements of the above m by m matrix are then selected for quan- tification, noting that these order statistics are in- dependent, contrary to the usual order statistics which are positively correlated. After i cycles, an unbiased estimator of the popul- ation mean, ju, is X(m)r = l_lj~mr ' (!) where X(i:m)j denotes the ith out of m order statis- tic from the jth cycle. The variance of X(m)r can be expressed as var(X(m)r) = ¿ 02 - ¿ 2C"(¡:m) - pf -, (2) 1 = 1 where /c(¡:m) is the mean of X(¡;m) and p and a2 are the overall mean and variance of all X. An un- biased estimator of this variance is given by var(X(m)r) = m2f^ _ (X(i:m)j-X(i:m)) 2&lt;3) 22 Ranking by concomitant variable When it is difficult or impossible to order the selected units by visual inspection, ranking may be accomplished via a covariate that is easily measured and is correlated with the variable of in- terest, X. The covariate, called a concomitant vari- able, is denoted by Y. To carry out the ranking, m bivariate samples each having m units are drawn from the population. The X value associated with the smallest ordered Y value is quantified from the first sample, then the X value associated with the second smallest Y value is quantified from the second sample and so on until the X value as- sociated with the largest Y value is quantified from the mth sample. As before, the whole cycle can then be repeated r times to obtain mr quan- tifications of the variable X. 3. Efficiency of RSS for estimating the population mean The value of ranked set sampling for estimating the mean can be evaluated by comparing the variance of the mean of a simple random sample consisting of rm observations to that of a ranked set sample of the same size. We do not compare to a simple random sample of size rm2 because the cost of identifying and ranking samples is con- sidered irrelevant compared to the cost of quan- tification. The relative precision, RP, of the two estimators is given by</page><page sequence="4">90 Johnson, Patii &amp; Sinha: Ranked set sampling Rp _ variance of mean with random sampling variance of mean with ranked set sampling var(Xmr) var(X(m)r) crVmr ìhfP-HÌ^)--")2) 1=1 T-à . &lt;«) '"iE1'»"!1 1 = 1 where T(ì) = Other useful measures of efficiency are relative cost (RC) and relative savings (RS), expressed as RC = j^p and RS = 1 - RC. In this context, the relative savings assumes the particularly simple form which is always non-negative, thus revealing how RSS is at least as cost effective as SRS with the same number of quantifications. Effect of the underlying distribution: For all continuous distributions with finite variance, Takahasi and Wakimoto (1968) showed that relative precision has the following bounds: 1 &lt; RP &lt; (m + l)/2, which again shows that RSS is at least as precise as SRS. The upper bound is realized only when the underlying distribution is uniform (rectan- gular). Mclntyre (1952) concluded that RP decreased with increasing skewness of the popula- tion. Drawing on the work of many other resear- chers, Dell (1969) and Dell and Clutter (1972) have tabulated the RP for common distributions as a function of the population mean, ft, variance, a2, skewness, 'fß[, and kurtosis, ß2, for various set sizes, m. Their work is reproduced in Table 1. Since the lognormal distribution (Crow and Shimizu 1988) is so common in nature, we have examined the efficiency of RSS relative to SRS particularly for lognormal populations. For a con- stant location parameter, ft, Table 2 reports the RP for a range of values of the shape parameter, o. For interpretation, consider that the squared coefficient of variation (CV)2 for the lognormal is (CV)2 = expío2) - 1, meaning that, for example, o = 1 corresponds to a coefficient of variation of 131 percent. In general, Table 2 shows that the performance of RSS for lognormal distributions decreases rather rapidly as the skewness increases (as o2 increases for a constant ft). To address the effects of skewness, Mclntyre (1952) suggested an unequal allocation of quan- tification effort to different ranks. Optimally, the frequency of quantification of a rank should be proportional to the standard deviation of the cor- responding order statistic (Neyman allocation). Numerical calculations by Mclntyre showed that considerable benefit could be obtained for the ex- ponential distribution but little was gained for beta distributions with integral shape parameters. Halls and Dell (1966) used unequal allocation in a field study and found a substantial reduction in the variance of the estimator. Meanwhile, Martin et al. (1980) obtained little or no gain using une- qual allocation; however, they allocated samples proportional to the variances of corresponding order statistics, not standard deviations. Takahasi and Wakimoto (1968) derived the bounds on RP for unequal allocation as 0 &lt; RP &lt; m which shows that inappropriate allocations can result in RP less than unity but a potential in- crease in RP that is much higher than with balanced allocation. 3.1 Effect of set size Choice of the set size (m) is an important design issue when planning ranked set sampling. Takahasi and Wakimoto (1968) have shown that var(X(m)r) is a decreasing function of m for a fixed number of quantifications, n=mr. Mathe- matically, then, the RSS estimator may be im- proved by decreasing r and increasing m for a fixed sample size, with the best design being r = 1. Tables 1 and 2 show how, for any value of r, ef- ficiency grows with increasing m for various populations. In practice, however, the errors in judgmental ranking typically increase with increasing set size. Therefore, while we want to maximize the m/r</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 91 Table 1.

To study this effect formally, Dell and Clutter (1972) used the model X[i:mļj = X(i:m)j + £ij , (5)</page><page sequence="6">92 Johnson, Patii &amp; Sinha: Ranked set sampling where X[ļ;m]j and X(j;m)j denote the "judgment order statistic" and the "true order statistic" respectively for the ith sample in the jth cycle, where X(¡:m)j and e¡j are independent and ey ~ N(0, a2). Dell and Clutter show that, in the presence of ranking error, the population mean estimator in equation 1 is unbiased and has precision that is at least as good as the SRS es- timator. In order to investigate the numerical effect of ranking error on RP, Dell and Clutter conducted 5000 computer simulation trials for select dis- tributions and set sizes over a range of random er- rors (of) from equation 5. Their results are reproduced in Table 3, where of = 0 corresponds to the case of perfect ranking and may be used as a benchmark. Dell and Clutter point out that equation 5 may not always be valid. For example, additivity of the error may be questioned. Also, judgmental com- parisons can be influenced by the set size as well as the magnitudes of the sampling units themsel- ves. With these issues in view, David and Levine (1972) suggested a theoretical approach for ob- taining values of RP in the presence of judgment error. For the case of an underlying normal dis- tribution, they obtained RP values that are reproduced here in Table 4. For those RP values that can be compared to Table 3, it is quite reas- suring to see very close agreement. 3.3 Use of a concomitant variable For the situation where ranking is done based on a concomitant variable, Stokes (1977) established that increased precision of the estimator depends on the degree of linear correlation between the variable of interest and the concomitant variable. Assuming that: (i) the regression of the variable Table 3.

With this model, he demonstrates that the RSS estimator of the population mean is unbiased and has smaller variance than the SRS estimator irrespective of within set dependence. Takahasi also showed that performance of the RSS procedure is degraded when the within-set joint distribution exhibits certain positive depen- dence similar to positive quadrat dependence, yet is enhanced in the case of negative dependence.

Using values of E(Z^¡;m)) from Teichroew (1956), these analytical results were ex- pressed numerically by Patii, Sinha &amp; Taillie (1992a) and are reproduced in Figures 1 and 2. In the case of perfect ranking, as seen in Figure 1, RSS is clearly superior to the regression es- timators unless the correlation is quite large (p &gt; .85), indicting that the rankings contain substan- tial information that cannot be captured by a covariate except at very large correlation. When ranking is according to a concomitant variable, there is little difference in performance except again at large correlation where the regression es- timator is better. However, not only must the cor- relation be high but the joint distribution of X and Y must be bivariate normal which is not a realistic expectation with vegetation distributions. Also, once the assumption of bivariate normality is violated, the regression estimator is no longer un- biased. 4. Estimating other population features Variance : When the number of cycles, r, is greater than one, an unbiased estimator of the population variance is given by C2 mr-m+1 v&lt; v«/v v ,2 °*ss = m2r/r m r(r-l)¡tl v&lt; v«/v " v X(i:m)&gt; m2r/r m r(r-l)¡tl jti 2 (X(i:m)-X(m)r)2 + 1=1 m (»&gt; due to Patii, Sinha and Taillie (1992b), which was also described briefly by Stokes (1976) in a dif- ferent form. If only one cycle exists, an asymptotically unbiased estimator presented by Stokes (1980) can be used. This is expressed as . (mr-1) 2121 (x0™)j-X(m)r)2. (12) If more than one cycle exists in the RSS design (r&gt;l), the unbiased estimator (equation 11) should be used because it is not only unbiased but also has precision that is always better than or equal to that of SRS. Furthermore, Patii, Sinha and Taillie (1992) have shown that the unbiased estimator has greater precision than the biased estimator for a wide variety of underlying distributions and set sizes. The biased estimator (equation 12) is presented for cases where r = 1; however, the precision of</page><page sequence="9">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 95 this estimator can actually be worse than the SRS estimator (Stokes 1980). Therefore, if the primary objective is to estimate the population variance (an unusual case), the sample design should have more than one cycle. Correlation coefficient : With respect to finding a better estimator of Pearson's correlation coefficient (p ) of a bivariate normal random vector (X,Y), Stokes (1976, 1980b) found that RSS as presented by Mclntyre (1952) was not better than SRS. This investiga- tion did, however, lead to a modified RSS protocol that made use of only the extreme order statistics (highest and lowest ranked values) and does appear to be more efficient than the SRS es- timator of p ; however, this depends on bivariate normality and no ranking error.

When based on RSS, the estimator, known as an empirical distribution function (edf), is unbiased and more efficient than when based on SRS, even with imperfect ranking. Numerical results indicate that the relative performance of the RSS estimator of F(t) with perfect ranking is quite good in the middle of the distribution (.1&lt; p &lt;.9). Although performance deteriorates rapidly in the tails, it is never less than with SRS. The authors also derive the null distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for the RSS es- timator of F(t) in the case of perfect ranking. Being less diffuse than the SRS, the RSS es- timator results in narrower simultaneous con- fidence bands about F(t). Since more information is contained in the RSS estimator of the whole distribution F(t) for any point t, then it is natural Figure 2.

Nonparametric testing: Using RSS to obtain the edf is essentially the first study of a nonparametric application of RSS. Now, for a one sample location problem, Hett- mansperger (1992) proposed a RSS sign test. He shows that, using the same number of observa- tions, the RSS sign statistic has smaller variance than the SRS statistic, and is subsequently more powerful. This property was observed even with imperfect ranking. Along with these results, he also showed that the RSS median has smaller asymptotic variance than the SRS median. A RSS version of the Mann-Whitney- Wilcoxon two-sample rank test was developed by Bohn and Wolfe (1992). These authors also found that the RSS based test was more powerful than the SRS version, using the same number of observations. 5. Applications in vegetation research 5.1 Forage yields Although Mclntyre's original proposal of estimat- ing pasture yields by "unbiased selective sampling using ranked sets" was made in 1952, no applica- tions were apparently reported until fourteen years later. Halls and Dell (1966) applied Mclntyre's method, coining it "ranked set sam- pling" for estimating the weights of browse and herbage in a pine-hardwood forest of east Texas. These authors discovered RSS to be considerably more efficient than SRS. Sets of three closely grouped quadrats were formed on a 300-acre tract. At select locations, metal frames of 3.1 square feet were placed at three randomly selected points within a circle of 13 foot radius. Quadrats were then ranked as highest, intermediate and lowest according to the perceived weight of browse and, separately, of herbage. Then, after clipping and drying, the separate weights of browse and herbage were determined for each quadrat. This was repeated for 126 sets for estimating browse and 124 sets for estimating herbage. In order to simulate the SRS estimator for the mean weight of browse, one quadrat was random- ly selected from each set without considering its rank. Therefore, what these authors called a simple random sample was actually a stratified random sample with equal weights. Since actual values were known for each quadrat, the RSS es- timator was obtained by randomly choosing the ranks to be quantified for each set, resulting in 43 highest ranks, 46 intermediate ranks and 37 lowest ranks. Halls and Dell also examined Mclntyre's suggestion that an unbalanced design might further improve the efficiency of estima- tion. Since the standard deviations for the order statistics were 27.7, 13 and 7 for the high, inter- mediate and low yield, respectively (ratio of 4:2:1), they selected 72 quadrats in the high group, 40 in the intermediate group and 14 in the low group. Note that perfect ranking was obtained for both RSS protocols because the actual values were already known for each quadrat. The mean and variance of the mean were calculated using the same formulation in equations 1 and 3, ad- justed for unequal r. Results of these three sampling protocols are reported in Table 7. As expected under perfect ranking, precision due to RSS with approximately equal allocation was doubled. Furthermore, when allocation was proportional to the order statistic</page><page sequence="12">98 Johnson, Patii &amp; Sinha: Ranked set sampling standard deviations, the precision was further in- creased, thus supporting Mclntyre's contention. Another very valuable aspect of this study was that two observers independently ranked the quadrats, one a professional range man and the other a woods worker. There was practically no difference in results between the two observers. 5.2 Seedling counts The effectiveness of RSS for improving the sam- pling precision of seedling counts was studied by Evans (1967) in an area in central Louisiana that was seeded to Longleaf Pine ( Pinus palustris Mill.). After dividing the target area into 24 blocks, each block was then subdivided into 25 one-milacre plots. All 600 plots were initially measured to characterize the population, which is summarized in Table 8a. The population mean and standard deviation were calculated to be 1.675 and 1.36, respectively. For the RSS protocol, three plots were randomly selected from each of the 24 blocks (sets), result- ing in 72 identified plots. The three plots within each set were then visually ranked. One cycle con- sisted of selecting the lowest ranked plot from the first set, the second lowest from the second set and the highest ranked plot from the third set. Repeating the cycle eight times yielded 24 selected plots in the ranked set sample (m=3, r=8). This whole procedure was repeated twice so that three separate field trials were performed, as summarized in Table 8b. Evans also computed the means and standard deviations of each rank using all 72 identified plots for each of the three field trials. These results are reproduced in Table 8c for comparison to the RSS results in Table 8b. In order to compare RSS to SRS, Evans resampled the 24 blocks (sets) 80 times to obtain two empirical distributions of the means, one based on the RSS estimator and the other based on the SRS estimator, which is actually a stratified random sample estimator. The results of this "bootstrapping" exercise are reproduced in Table 8d where we see a significant reduction in the variance due to RSS. 5.3 Shrub phytomass in forest stands The performance of RSS for estimating shrub phytomass (all vegetation between one and five meters high) was evaluated by Martin et al. (1980) at a forested site in Virginia. They investigated four major vegetation types along a decreasing moisture gradient: mixed hardwood, mixed oak, mixed oak and pine, and mixed pine. For each vegetation type a 20m by 20m area was subjective- ly located which was further divided into 16 plots of equal size (5m by 5m). For the RSS procedure, four sets of four plots were randomly selected from the 16 plots in each vegetation type. The plots in each set were then ranked by visual inspection, followed by quantify- ing the smallest ranked plot from the first set, the second smallest ranked plot from the second set and so on in the usual manner for RSS. This was repeated for each of the four vegetation types. For the SRS procedure, four out of the 16 plots in each vegetation type were randomly selected without replacement, followed by quantification of each selected plot. Again, this is actually a stratified random sample since each vegetation type is a separate strata. Shrub phytomass was also determined for all 64 plots to obtain a grand mean and variance for comparison. Their results are reproduced in Table 9 where we see a substan- tial increase in precision of the mean estimator associated with RSS. 5.4 Herbage mass In order to compare RSS to SRS for estimating herbage mass in pure grass swards and both her- bage mass and clover content in mixed grass- clover swards, Cobby et al. (1985) conducted four experiments at Hurley (UK). Besides comparison of RSS to SRS, their other objective was to assess the effects of the following factors on RSS: (i) im- perfect ranking within sets, (ii) greater variation between sets than within sets, and (iii) asymmetric distribution of the quantified values. The first two experiments were conducted by ran- domly selecting 15 locations, followed by random- ly selecting three quadrats at each location and having several observers rank the quadrats within each set. For the last two experiments, 45 quad- rats were drawn at random from the entire target area. This allowed an assessment of the effects of both spatial variation and ranking errors within sets. Their results are reproduced in Table 10, where RP of both the worst and best observers are com- pared to the RP under perfect ranking, and the between and within set variances are presented for assessing spatial variation. These authors determined the main adverse factor to be within set clustering, and they recommend spacing quad- rats within sets as far apart as possible when local spatial autocorrelation exists.

Summary and future directions Ranked set sampling (RSS) can obviously in- crease one's observational economy relative to random sampling when assessing natural resour- ces. This conclusion is not only based on theoreti- cal results but also on a variety of field trials performed over the last two and a half decades. Although double sampling for linear regression may be more efficient than RSS for estimating the population mean in certain situations, these situa- tions seem to be rather restrictive. For example, double sampling for regression not only requires a concomitant variable, but it must have a bivariate normal joint distribution with the variable of in- terest, otherwise the estimator is biased. Even if this condition is satisfied, double sampling for regression is only more precise when the correla- tion between the concomitant and primary vari- ables is very high (p2 &gt; .85). We are currently examining the relative precision of RSS, compared to both stratified random sam- pling and double sampling for stratification. It is already a known fact that if sample units are not appropriately allocated into strata, then stratified random sampling can actually yield a less precise estimator than obtained from simple random sampling, whereas precision of the simple random sample estimator is an* absolute lower bound for the RSS estimator. A particularly exciting issue is the collaboration of RSS and remote sensing. Indices such as green- ness, brightness and texture derived from satellite images may serve as concomitant variables for ranking vegetation samples prior to actual field sampling. Multivariate indices may also be developed for combining several concomitant variables. On one hand, RSS may provide a very efficient way to obtain "ground-truthing" data for supporting information obtained from satellite images. On the other hand, when the ground sample is of primary interest, remote sensing in-</page><page sequence="15">Abstracta Botanica 17 (1993) 101 formation may provide reliable concomitant vari- ables for ranking samples prior to even entering the field. In either case, the effort for obtaining such information may be reduced considerably. Johnson and Myers (1993) recently proposed such a collaboration for conducting more rapid assess- ments of natural resource damage after catas- trophic events. Finally, we note that ranked set sampling is not restricted to vegetation studies but has great potential for observational economy in many ap- plications, especially soil sampling at hazardous waste sites (Patii, Sinha and Taillie 1993).
