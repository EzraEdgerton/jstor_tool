Abstract. A fractal-based, scale invariant measure of 'community evenness' is proposed. The method begins by computing the Shannon entropy (H) and species richness (AO for each of q relevés. Using a fractal-based power law relationship, community evenness J is then determined from the slope of the H versus log2 N plot. Community evenness is thus a scale-invariant measure of the relationship between species richness and Shannon entropy for a set of relevés. The method is illustrated using data from 16 beech forest community relevés in the Lucretili Mountains of central Italy. Introduction Biodiversity, and in particular the study of species dis- tribution-abundance relationships in space and time, is one of the cornerstones of ecological research. The primary goal of such research is to obtain an under- standing of biodiversity patterns, and how these pat- terns relate to and are driven by underlying ecological processes. Biodiversity studies thus focus on spatio- temporal patterns in the allocation of individuals among species. Diversity indices quantify ecological meaningful aspects of biodiversity, based on the dis- tribution of individuals among species (Franc 1998). Biodiversity indices based on information theory have a long history of use in ecology (e.g. Pielou 1966, Rosenzweig 1995). Given a plant community com- posed of N species, in which n¡ is the number of in- dividuals belonging to the ith species (i= 1, 2, ..., AO, the relative frequency (p¡) of n¡ is: N A = vXn&lt; [U /=1 where 0 &lt; pt &lt; 1, and the p¡ values sum to one. The amount of statistical information (entropy) contained in the observation of a value n¡ is H( n¡) = -log2 p¡ (Shan- non 1948; the base 2 logarithm is used to measure in- formation content in bits). An important property of Shannon entropy is that H(n¡, nj) = H(n¡) + H(nj) when n¡ and n¡ are independent. The Shannon entropy of a community composed of N species is then defined as the mean of the entropy associated with the single species: N H = -£ Pi log2 Pi [2] /=1 This is Shannon's fundamental equation describing the information content in signals that carry a message of infinite length from source to destination. The theoreti- cal basis for interpreting Shannon's entropy as a measure of information relates to the intriguing con- nection between information theory and the concept of entropy in classic statistical mechanics (Franc 1998). From an ecological viewpoint, the entropy H of a given community is a measure of uncertainty in predicting the relative abundance of species. Further- more, since uncertainty is maximal when entropy is highest, the entropy concept forms the basic founda- tion of biodiversity theory (Orlóci 1991). It is therefore not surprising that entropy-related studies appear in</page><page sequence="2">1 14 Ricotta et al.: Community diversity and evenness early works on community structure (e.g. Margalef 1958, Pielou 1966). It is easily demonstrated that the maximum value of Shannon's entropy //max = log2 N is obtained from an equiprobability distribution ( p¡ = pj for all species pairs ij). Conversely, minimum entropy (//min = 0) occurs when only one species is present in the community. Normalization of H with respect to maximum entropy (J = H/Hmaoii termed 'evenness') measures deviation from an equidistribution of individuals amongst the N species (Pielou 1966). Information theory offers the advantage of universal identifiability when describing community biodiver- sity (Orlóci 1991). However, Shannon's entropy has some drawbacks when it is used to determine biodiver- sity from a sample of finite size (Hill 1973). Specifi- cally, a sample produces an estimate of the distribution of individuals among species, but this estimate deviates to an unknown extent from the actual com- munity value. Furthermore, the number of species (AO enumerated increases non-linearly as sample size in- creases (Kvalseth 1991). As a consequence, estimates of community biodiversity and evenness are sample- size dependent (Kempton 1979, Alatalo 1981). In phytosociology, minimal area analysis is often used to determine the floristic composition of a representa- tive region of 'homogeneous' vegetation. The minimal area, which is somewhat arbitrarily defined as the smallest area required to adequately characterize a species assemblage, is determined by plotting species richness against area (Westhoff &amp; van der Maarel 1978). However, it is recognized that no method (or area) is perfectly suited for characterizing the com- plete species assemblage of a community (Bunge &amp; Fitzpatrick 1993). In this contribution, we develop and test a fractal- based measure of 'community evenness' for a set of releves. The method is illustrated using data on 16 releves from a beech forest community in the Lucretili Mountains of central Italy. The concept of community evenness In phytosociology, diversity and evenness measures are usually determined from data obtained by totalling individual species counts over a sample consisting of q releves. A rich literature has developed around problems associated with using a sample to estimate biodiversity parameters (see Kvalseth 1991 and references therein). However, the loss of information associated with totalling species counts across releves has received far less attention. It is important to note that information on the florisitic composition of in- dividual releves is lost when sampled species data are pooled. An alternative approach to characterizing the community is to implicitly incorporate information on relevé-specific diversity. With this in mind, we develop a fractal-based measure of 'community evenness' that relates species richness N and Shannon entropy H over a set of relevés. Fractal geometry (Mandelbrot 1982) is well-suited to the description and characterization of biological and ecological patterns, since complex natural phenomena are not realistically modelled using simple Euclidean forms (Frontier 1987, Sugihara &amp; May 1990, Johnson et al. 1995, Kenkel &amp; Walker 1996, Milne 1997). At- tempts to split a fractal into smaller pieces result in the resolution of the same general pattern, regardless of the scale at which the pattern is examined. The statis- tical characterization of a fractal is therefore indepen- dent of the scale at which the measurement is made. For this reason, fractal objects and processes are said to display scale-invariant properties. Scale-invariance manifests itself algebraically through a power-law relationship. Specifically, a measure of a set F (with measurement unit size 8) has the following relation- ship to 8 (Johnson et al. 1995): MJ(F) = C8-D [3] where D is the fractal dimension of F and c is the " D - dimensional" length of F (Falconer 1990). Natural ob- jects or processes typically take on noninteger values of the fractal dimension D. Frontier (1985, 1987) notes that the fractal power-law relationship is relevant to the analysis of community diversity and evenness. The species diversity of a phytosociological relevé can be determined using Shannon's entropy //, which can be expressed as the product of Pielou 's evenness J and the logarithm of the number of species: H = (H/HmãK)Hmax = J'og2N [4] Furthermore, since H is the mathematical expectation of -log2 Pi when calculated over a set of N species, it can be expressed as: H =E(-log2 pò = 'og2 A [5] I j where A = 2 is the 'effective species richness' (Hill 1973), defined as the theoretical (diversity-equivalent) number of species that would result if all species were equifrequent. It follows that Pielou' s evenness J can be written as: J = log2 Af log2 N [6] which takes the form of a fractal power-law relation- ship when expressed as A = NJ (Equation [3]).

We propose computing a scale-invariant measure of 'community evenness' 7, based on Shannon entropy H and species richness N values determined for each of q relevés. From the power-law relationship A = Af7, com- munity evenness J is given as the slope of the regres- sion of H - log2 A versus log2 N. Community evenness is thus interpretable as a scale-invariant measure of the relationship between species richness and entropy for the set of q releves. Materials and methods Study area Lucretili Mountains Natural Park in central Italy is a region of complex topographic variation. Maximum elevation is 1368 m above sea level. The study area belongs to the lower mountainous bioclimatic belt (Blasi 1994). The climate is strongly influenced by the</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 22 ( 1 998) 117 position of the Lucretili Massif, which forms a transversal barrier to the western sea-winds. At the Posticciola meteorological station (540 m above sea level), the mean annual air temperature is 12.4 °C. Mean annual rainfall is 1054.9 mm, with a principal maximum occurring in the autumn and a secondary maximum in winter. Mean rainfall in the June- August quarter is 156.4 mm. Precipitation within the study area is strongly affected by the steep altitudinal gradient. Vegetation and sampling Sampling was restricted to the beech forests of Lucretili Mountains Natural Park, which represent a nearly continuous formation due to the absence of in- tensive cutting activities. These beech forests belong to the Aquifolio-Fagetum association, which occurs in the lower mountain belt of southern and central Italy (Gentile 1969, Feoli &amp; Lagonegro 1982). The charac- teristic species of this association are Daphne lau- reola, Ilex aquifolium , Euphorbia amy gdalo ides, Lathy rus venetus , Melica uniflora and Anemone apen- nina. The vegetation was enumerated in 16 releves using protocols of the Braun-Blanquet school of phytosociology (Westhoff &amp; van der Maarel 1978). The complete data are given in Table 1. Data analysis Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance values were first converted to cover values, following van der Maarel (1979). Next, Shannon entropy H and species richness N values were determined for each of the 16 relevés. The scale-invariant community evenness J of the beech forest relevés was then calculated from the slope of the regression line of the plot of H versus log N. Results and discussion The scale-invariant 'community evenness' for the Lucretili beech forest community is J = 1.912(Fig. 1), indicating that the diversity-equivalent number of species (A) for the 16 relevés scales as N1'912. In other words, a relevé with 2 N species contains, on average, 21*912 = 3.763 times as many 'diversity-equivalent' species as one containing only N species. For a given community, J is thus interpretable as a scale-invariant dimension of the distribution of individuals among species, studied as to diversity (Frontier 1987). To clarify our definition of 'community evenness', consider three simple data sets each containing 9 releves (Table 2, Fig. 2): Figure 1. Scatterplot of Shannon's entropy ( H) as a function of log species rich- ness (AO for the 16 relevés in Table 1. The slope of the regression line is J = 1.912 (/r = 0.81 l,p&lt; 0.01).</page><page sequence="6">1 1 8 Ricotta et al. : Community diversity and evenness Table 2.

The slope of the corresponding log-log plot is also J - 0.8. (b) Per-relevé evenness increases with increas- ing species richness N (2.63/3.75 = 0.70 for the least rich relevé, 5.67/6.30 = 0.90 for the richest relevé). H and log(N) are positively correlated.

The slope of the corresponding log-log plot is 7 = 0.4. It is interesting to note that the Lucretili beech forest community scales as in case (b): species-poor relevés have much lower evenness values (H/'ogN = 0.45) than species-rich relevés ( H/ìogN = 0.82). Is this a general feature of plant communities? Can 'com- munity evenness' J be used to distinguish between dif- ferent communities? Are there predictable ecological processes underlying these community patterns? These are critical questions, and their answers may provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal distributions of species richness and evenness. Acknowledgements.
