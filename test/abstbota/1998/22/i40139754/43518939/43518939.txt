Abstract. The vegetation history of the Anderson pond site is well known from the pioneering work of Hazel R. Delcourt. Yet it is a fact that the site's paleopollen record is far from having been fully explored for information. This is particularly true when one considers the characteristics of the process itself. It is in this area that this paper presents results, revealing prevalently unimodal taxon density graphs, intensely periodic community stability curves, and a surprising lack of evidence of significant compositional "backtracking". The results also reveal compositional transitions under the alternating dominance of determinism and randomness, and further, significant process homogeneity within a relevant geographic domain. The theoretical and practical consequences of the latter become particularly obvious when one considers that once geographic process homogeneity is shown, the relevance of the hypothesis of individualistic vegetation dynamics is relegated to the level of a partial truth to the extent to which process behaviour reflects the random effects. It is peculiar that because random effects dominate the process in the short run, predictions of the immediate future by extrapolation are likely to be erroneous. 1. The notion and importance of scale In his classic 1992 paper, P. Juhász-Nagy makes the point vividly clear how pervasive is the scale and the scaling problem in ecology. Indeed, it would be fool- hardy to proceed with this essay without first address- ing its general scale determinants. A "scale" materialises with our choice of variables that link per- formance, time, and space. Since our objective is the study of vegetation dynamics in nature, the states we observe are unchangeable by the choice of scale variables. The choice affects our perception of the dynamics' characteristics. In very specific terms, when for instance the time step size is small (say a year), and period length is one or two decades (which is typical in permanent plot dynamic studies), the characteristics of stand level dominance sorting are brought into view. This is the scale at which one may find the Gleasonian doctrine of chance-driven vegetation dynamics quite fathomable1. Should time step size increase by one order of magnitude, many of the stand level details will likely be scaled out of view and the process could may appear to be moving in the direction of a particular state, the "attractor" (Anand &amp; Orlóci 1997). At this scale, many would find accep- table the Clementsian idea of an action-reaction driven climax succession . Should the time step widen by yet another order of magnitude, only the macro- vegetation transitions would remain discernible. This macro level is typically the scale at which dynamic studies utilising 1 See comments in the Appendix. 2 We point out that the term "succession" was formulated to describe "vegetation development" under a reasonably stable climate (Huit 1885, Clements 1916, Phillips 1935).</page><page sequence="2">82 He &amp; Orlóci: Anderson Pond revisited paleopollen spectra operate. We refer to vegetation dynamics on this macro level as the "precession dynamics" which is not of a feedback type . We em- phasise that while the observer's choice of scale has the effect of bringing into focus one or another aspect of vegetation dynamics, these aspects are manifesta- tion of the same unified process: a perpetual assembly and disassembly of the vegetation community. The scale chosen can dampen or sharpen appearances, but beyond this, it cannot add to or subtract anything from the basic facts. 2. The evidence 2.1 The choice of site We selected the Anderson Pond site for testing ideas and techniques about long-term vegetation dynamics for the high quality of the paleopollen record (Delcourt 1979) and the convenience of its free availability from archive4. There are other sites just as well endowed with reliable paleopollen records. Our choice fell on Anderson Pond because it is in a unique geographic location, at 36°N and 85°W just south of the most southern extent of the last (Laurentide) continental ice sheet. The Anderson Pond paleopollen record is in fact an open book, as it were, of the Laurentide climatic in- fluence on the vegetation, over the past 24 millennia. 2.2 The paleopollen relevé and choice of taxa The complete paleopollen density record of taxa at a given point in the paleopollen profile of sediments is our paleorelevé. In the example, this is a 28-valued vector. The taxa in this represent genera and some families (Fig. 1). The selection was aided by a com- munality ranking technique (Orlóci 1978). Our subset of 28 taxa recovered the original database covariance configuration of 100 taxa virtually without distortion. 2.3 Considerations of the time scale As expected with a raw pollen spectrum, the core sample depth and the dated age lack a simple one-to- one relationship. This is the consequence of variable sedimentation rates and sediment losses attributable to decomposition and erosion. It is for these reasons that sediment depth is a weak surrogate for time. Now, if core samples are taken at regular depths, the time step size will vary. In the archived Anderson Pond records the time step size ranges over three orders of mag- nitude (xlO to xlO3). This sets the global resolving power of the records at not better than the precession scale. To prepare the data set for time series analysis, we ad- justed the time steps by interpolation to a uniform step size of 100 years. This gave us 241 virtual relevés over a period of 24,100 years to replace the real relevés of the dated sediment horizons. The records begin with paleopollen counts dominated by North American Boreal taxa. The present zonal vegetation of the site is classified as the southern fringe of the Eastern Temperate Deciduous Forest. 2.4 How reliable is the evidence? Reasoning from paleopollen spectra about vegetation dynamics is normal practice, but is not without pitfalls. We mention those that we consider the most serious: 1. Disturbed pollen bearing sediments. Györffy and Zólyomi (1996) discuss the consequences of missing horizons removed by decomposition and erosion. 2. Taxonomie levels mixed in the records. This problem cannot be corrected, unless one would relax the taxonomie premise. Pillar &amp; Orlóci (1991) discuss possibilities in great detail. 3. High measurement errors in sediment dating relative to total period length. This can be as much as hundreds of years if the isotope method is used, ruling out actual resolution of vegetation dynamics at better than the precession level. 4. Unforeseen consequences of data adjustments. We mention the expression of paleopollen densities as per- centages within relevés. This has the effect of scaling that may change the data structure (Orlóci 1978). This, in turn, may affect the observer's perception of the process. We also mention the forcing of uniform time steps upon the records by interpolation, which we have done. We are very much aware that this is not without some consequences on the interpretation of "back- tracking" and other properties of dynamics. 5. Errors of paleopollen density calibration. We imply errors of a measurement-theoretical type, not 3 With the term "precession" we intend to emphasise the strong connection of the vegetation process to global climate change expected in the wake of cyclic changes in the Earth's orbital motions (Milankovitch 1941). It is important, of course, to see clearly that global climate change is very much under the joint influence of the Earth's orbital dynamics, the solar radiation cycles, and the evolving gross composition of the Earth's atmosphere (Houghton &amp; Whewell 1989, Wallace 1990 and references therein). 4 North American Pollen Database (Grimm 1993). The database archives detail site descriptions, calibrated and dated pollen counts for 100 populations at different taxonomie levels (mainly genera and family) and other types of relevant data needed to describe the core site.

Delcourt &amp; Delcourt (1987) supp- ly arguments and references on calibration. 6. No direct information is available about population in- teractions and action-reaction feedback. Clearly, if for no other reasons than this, inferences about the vegetation process from pollen spectra are inherently "soft". 3. The modus operandi and results 3.1 A very basic question Vegetation dynamics at all scales has received atten- tion in the past. Monographs and review articles abound on the topic (see Mcintosh 1980, 1985, Shugart 1984, Fekete 1985, Anand &amp; Orlóci 1997 and references therein). The questions we see frequently asked about dynamics fall into three broad categories: 1 . the timing of change when taxa appear or disappear in the site; 2. the spatial extent of change as a geographic distribu- tion pattern; 3. the driving force of change (the causal factors). We take inquiries into dynamics in the direction of process identification by asking the question: "What is the functional form of the process recorded in the paleopollen spectrum?" To answer this, we postulate dynamic models and test the deviation of an observed process from a postulated model. The models are such that we can characterise vegetation dynamics such as random, deterministic, linear, non-linear, periodic, homogeneous, heterogeneous, etc. Very simple con- structs can serve our purpose. These include curves of deviations, Eigenmappings, fitted Markov chain, decomposed graphs by Fourier and Chebyshev mathe- matics, etc. We emphasise that to identify the process type by a model is not the same as discovering the fac- tors actually driving the process. It is also true, of course, that without knowing the process type, the causal factors cannot be discovered. 3.2 Taxon deviation graphs An obvious characteristic of the vegetation process is the turnover of taxa with the passing of time. Simple examination of taxon deviation graphs, constructed from dated paleopollen data (from undisturbed sedi- ments), will reveal reliably the type, the rate, and the timing of the turnover. Such graphs display paleopol- len densities as deviations from random expectation as a function of time. Random expectation is the state of a taxon 's pollen density that one would expect at a given time point in the paleopollen spectrum if com- positional transitions in the site were chance driven. This is a broad definition and it can be applied at dif- ferent levels of specificity (see Pillar &amp; Orlóci 1996): 1. Random taxa assumed. The grand mean of the paleopollen densities in the total spectrum is expecta- tion (EGM). 2. Random density fluctuations within taxa assumed. If no hypothesis requires otherwise, the expected pol- len density is derived either as 2a. the taxon mean pollen density (ETM) or 2b. a quantity proportional to the marginal totals (EPMT) of a taxa x time contingency table5. We use definition EPMT for which the reason is to make the expected value for a taxon dependent upon the total paleopollen record. Figure 1 displays taxon deviation graphs. The ordinate of any point on the graph, not directly on the zero line, indicates over-representation (positive deviation) or under-representation (negative deviation) of the taxon involved. We draw attention to the frequent unimodal graph shape. It is clear from this that dominance is rarely repeated by the same taxon. 3.3 Community deviation graphs These graphs display the pooled squared deviations of all taxa in the community as a function of time. We associate a decreasing graph height with increasing stability. Our justification for this is information theoretical, meaning that the community is at its "most stable state" when the taxa are represented in propor- tions of their random expectations. 3.4 Angles and distances graphs Figure 2 displays a graph for angles and another for compositional distances. The distances are measured 5 Reference is made to Orlóci (1991). Taxa are the row entities. The columns, marking time points of the process, are the paleorelevés. It is important to note when considering deviations that a zero observed value may in fact signify a deviation other than zero. Furthermore, option EPMT is equivalent to ETM when the paleopollen densities are expressed as percentages of the relevé totals. Clearly, a priori percentage adjustment of paleopollen densities confines the choice of random expectation. The question is really, why should we want to apply a percentage adjustment? We point out that implicit in any adjustment is the assumption that Nature works that way. If this is true for percentage adjustment, but not born out directly by the sample densities, the adjustment should be made a part of the definition of random expectation, and not a manipulation of the observed densities. At this point we refer back to the section on the Reliability of Evidence.</page><page sequence="4">84 He &amp; Orlóci: Anderson Pond revisited Figure 1.

Note the vertical scale differences. between neighbouring community states on the process trajectory mapping in Fig. 3. The angle is al- ways the inner angle measured between adjacent line segments connecting community states. This captures the changing process direction. Angles and distances have joint synoptic value in the sense that a large dis- tance associated with a small angle is an indication of dramatic transition (in pollen density terms) from one time point to the next in the evolving vegetation community. It is important to remember that sharp angles may come about by sharp changes in the proportionate representation of the taxa already represented in the pollen-pool or by the entrance of new taxa in numbers. 3.5 An unavoidable question: how large is large? The nature of dynamic studies is such that the inter- pretation of magnitude, whether it is concerning the size of a primary variable or of some secondary (emer- gent) attribute, have to be made on a universally com- parable scale. The probability scale is universally comparable. On this scale we declare a given value of the observed variable "large" if the probability of an equally or more extreme value occurring by chance is small. We derive probabilities in randomisation ex- periments under specific assumptions whose exact na- ture depends on the problem. Regarding the details of the basics of randomisation experiments we refer to Edgington (1987) in general and to Pillar (1996) and</page><page sequence="5">Abstracta Botanica 22 ( 1 998) 85 Figure 2. Evolution of pooled squared deviation (top), process direction (middle) and compositional distance (bot- tom) over time in the Anderson Pond site. The horizontal axis is time in steps of 100 years. Squared deviations are pooled over 28 taxa. The line across top figure is the upper limit of the 0.95 confidence belt for pooled squared devia- tions. Process direction is measured as the inner angle (180° or less) between the line segments connecting neighbour points in Figure 3. Zero angle implies reversal of process direction and 180° angle indicates no change of direction. Distances are the lengths of the line segments between neighbouring points in Figure 3. Pillar &amp; Orlóci (1996) in a relevant field of ecology. The confidence limit in Fig. 2 was derived in a ran- domisation experiment under the assumption of an en- tirely chance driven process. Clearly the observed graph in Fig. 2 represents a process not of the assumed type, but one that is characterised by strong deter- minism. 3.6 Process trajectory It is practical to view vegetation dynamics as a chain of events (releves) in time. We refer to this chain as a trajectory that we portray as an irregular line in Fig. 3. The axes of this figure correspond to taxa. The points on the line are chronologically ordered. The initial paleorelevé is the starting point. With the passing of time, the composition of the vegetation community un- dergoes change that will push the evolving "paleorelevé" as a point onwards on the trajectory at velocities measured by the magnitude of the distance of the neighbour states separated by equal time steps. If only quantities changed but the proportions of the different pollen types remained the same, the trajec- tory should be a straight line. Any change of direction implies changes in proportions. Figure 3 displays the Anderson Pond site process trajectory in a reference space created by Eigenanalysis (Orlóci 1978) of the original data. The advantage of this type of reference space is that it is parsimonious and linear. Parsimonious means that a minimum number of axes convey maximum informa- tion about the trajectory. The reference system being linear, a non-linear process trajectory will show up as a curved line. Three characteristics of the observed trajectory are obvious: 1 . Nonlinear shape. 2. Definite linear, nonlinear phase structure. 3. No global backtracking of community composi- tion. The non-linear phases are regions where the trajectory is turning and twisting in a chaotic manner. The lack of backtracking is apparent from the general direction of the trajectory pointing away from the initial state, even though similar climatic conditions may have returned from time to time to the site. The bottom graph in Fig. 3 portrays the trajectory in a reference space created by Eigenanalysis of the ex- pected paleopollen densities under EPMT. The dif- ference of this and the observed trajectory is most striking. It is most interesting to see a sharp phase structure retained. If we analysed expectations under EGM or ETM, the reference space would reduce to a single point. 3.7 Testing the trajectory for random transitions We have two methods to present which differ in their definition of the reference distance configuration: 1. Markov distance configuration as reference. The releves for which the reference configuration is</page><page sequence="6">86 He &amp; Orlóci: Anderson Pond revisited Figure 3. Observed process trajectory (in stereo view) and the expected trajectory (bottom) for the Anderson Pond site. The co-ordinates are Eigenscores. Axes are scaled to have the sum of squared Eigenscores be equal to the corresponding Eigen- value. The points on the lines represent successive paleorelevés (top) and expected paleorelevés (bottom) at 100-year steps. The mapping of the original configuration is 97% accurate. The mapping of the expected configuration is 100% accurate. Legend: Pa - past, Pr - present. defined are states of a Markov chain. The relevé chain is generated by the recursive relation MpM^P. In this, symbol t designates time and P stands for the tran- sition probability matrix of the taxa. We relied on the "losses and gains" method of Orlóci, Anand &amp; He (1993) to determine the elements of P from the paleopollen records. We note that in matrix P the row sums are equal to one. Vector Mi contains the paleopollen counts in the Anderson Pond site's 24,100 years old sediment layer. To test for Markov type tran- sitions, we compare the observed distance configura- tion taken from the top graph of Fig. 3 to the Markov distance configuration, after due standardisation. Our test criterion is a stress function (Orlóci, Anand and He 1993). The derivation of a reference distribution for stress involves random reordering of the paleorelevés many times over, each rearrangement being followed by computation of new distance configurations and a Table 1. Levels of conformity with the hypothesis of global random transitions given the Markov chain as the alterna- tive in the Anderson Pond site. The observed stress is 1.578. This is a measure of the divergence of the observed paleorelevé distance configuration from the fitted Markov distance configuration. The stress values in the table are probability points in the distribution of the stress variable under random permutation of the paleorelevés. Regarding the experiment, the greater is the value of stress, the more likely that the random transitions alternative is in fact true. In the table, a is the probability that under the random tran- sitions hypothesis the stress value can be equal to or less than the given probability point. In these terms a value 1.578 is considered small which then calls for rejection of the hypothesis of globally chance driven transitions. a .01 .05 .1 Probability point 1.620 1.638 1.641</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 22 ( 1 998) 87 Table 2.

The base of the analysis is the top graph in Figure 2. Considering a typical table row, say the 3rd, the entries pertain to the 2nd residual graph. In this, the best fitting sine wave has maximum height 7926 in deviation units (from random expectation) and wave frequency 8. The sine curve is shifted by A (k)= A(ļ)(k)/(2/:7t) = 24100 x (-1.495) / (8 x 6.283) = -715 years. Negative A(k) indicates the quadrant in which ty(k) occurs. Sym- bol A represents period length in years, k is wave frequency, and ty(k)/k stands for phase shift, the distance of the crest of the first sine wave from the origin. This is in fact a measure of how far the initial state receeded from maximum instability. We use S(k) as an index of stability defined by S(k) = 1- cos §(k) = 1- Y(k)o/Y(k)max where Y(k)0 is the intercept. The Q (k)% quantities are measures of how much of the graph of the pooled squared deviations is accounted for by the individual sine curves.

Table 1 gives the numerical results. These reveal compelling evidence to accept a weak form of Markovity as a suitable model for tran- sitions in the trajectory. 2. Time step distance configuration as reference. Elapsed time distances are computed between pairs of paleorelevés. The observed compositional distance configuration (from Fig. 3) is compared to the elapsed time distance configuration by a correlation value. We call this the observed correlation. We also do this in another way when we replace all distances by their rank order (within the rows of the matrices) and then calculate the correlation value. In either case, ran- domisation testing is applied to derive a reference dis- tribution for the correlation. The numerical results are given in Table 2. It can be seen that the correlation is colossal, whether we express it in standard units (Z value) or in terms of probabilities derived under the as- sumption of random transitions. The results reinforce the proposition that the process has an overall deter- ministic component. 3.8 Probing the process for periodicity We look for periodicity in stability terms. Two models help us in this: the sine wave and the polynomial. Relevant ideas are addressed in mathematical manuals dealing with Fourier analysis and Chebyshev polynomials. 1. The sine wave model. Ray ner (1971) describes the technique through a simple application. In our case the input data include the complete set of summed squared deviations (graphed in Fig. 2). Regarding the computa-</page><page sequence="8">88 He &amp; Orlóci: Anderson Pond revisited Figure 4. Sine waves fitted to the pooled squared deviations graph of Figure 2 and to residuals therefrom. Graph (a): devia- tions graph and best-fitting sine wave. Graphs (b) to (d): successive residuals with their best fitting sine waves. The total sum of squares accounted for by the residuals is 54% of the total (graph (a)). See numerical results in Table 3. tions, first a sine curve is fitted to the graph, then the residuals are extracted. Next, a sine wave is fitted to the residuals and new residuals are extracted. The computations continue in a like manner until the residuals become negligible in magnitude. The sine waves are such that their sum reproduces the original pooled squared deviations graph. Notwithstanding the rigidity of this completely regular model, we believe a good purpose can be served by the analysis in first- level probing of the data for wave frequencies and re- lated characteristics. The numerical results are presented in Table 3, and the original curve, 1st sine wave, and some residuals in Fig. 4. 2. Polynomial model. The exercise of fitting Chebyshev polynomials has to be seen as one different from fitting sine waves in respect of technique as well as intent. First, the fitted polynomial can have any ir- regular shape. The shape of the sine wave is fixed. Second, when the order of the polynomial is increased, the polynomial fit can improve. Changes of wave fre- quency or the wave amplitude will render the fitted sine curve no longer best fitting. It is indeed valid to speak of a best fitting sine wave, but not of a "best fit- ting" polynomial. Third, the notion of extrapolation forward in time is meaningful in the case of sine waves by virtue of their regularity in time. Extrapolation for- ward is meaningless with polynomials. We use the same input in the Chebyshev polynomials that we used for sine waves fitting and proceed with the analysis through similar steps as with sine waves. Recursive polynomial fitting and calculation of residuals stops when the remaining residuals are seen negligible in magnitude. Figure 5 gives the observed curve and fitted polynomials. It can be seen that the first polynomial leaves only minor random oscillations of the sums of deviations for the second. 4. General discussion 4.1 The art of reasoning To a keen observer of Nature, the task of revealing in- trinsic properties and suggesting causes calls up first of</page><page sequence="9">Abstracta Botanica 22(1 998) 89 Figure 5. Chebyshev polynomial fitted to summed squared deviations (see Figure 2) and to the residuals therefrom. First graph: pooled squared deviations graph and fitted polynomial. Second graph: first residual set and fitted polynomial. The polynomial is of order 20 in each case. The axes are same as in Figure 4. Coefficients of determination: 0.669 (first graph), 0.065 (second graph). all the exercise of reasoning from basic principles aided by clues from observation of analogue cases. To early workers in vegetation dynamics, often the clues came from the natural order of species and com- munities on moisture and climatic gradients. Reason- ing from such clues produced much information and numerous finely crafted theories about vegetation dynamics (Kerner von Marilaun 1864, Warming 1884, Cowles 1899, Cooper 1926, Clements 1916, 1928, and Whittaker 1953). These postulate the orderliness of progress in vegetation dynamics on converging or parallel trajectory lines driven by action-reaction feed- back (in terms of our terminology). 4.2 A proposition debated Readers interested in tracing the historical views and approaches are referred to the many references in Anand and Orlóci (1997). We take from this immense bulk of literature the review paper of Glenn-Lewin, Peet &amp; Veblen (1992) which brings into sharp focus aspects of a debate germane in the proposition of "... a shift away from holistic explanations of vegetation succession6 towards reductionist and mechanistic ap- proaches emphasising the causes of vegetation chan- ges." Well said, but we do not agree with the assess- ment. In fact we are convinced that such a shift makes no sense at all, if it were to imply disconnecting in- ference about the vegetation process from the holistic mode of ecological reasoning. Usher (1981,1992) and van Hülst (1992) express good thoughts on these and we offer others in an earlier paper (Anand and Orlóci 1997). The point to be emphasised is that we do con- sider reductionism as one face in a complex mode of thinking about ecological phenomena and analysing things. But we do believe that to elevate an inductive reductionist approach to the status of the dominant logic in the study of the vegetation dynamics is not just contradictory to common sense thinking, but also tan- tamount to being fundamentally out of whack with trends in Science. In particular, a turning toward more complete holistic thinking and deductive reasoning is the order of the day, clearly explained in a popular ac- count by Gleick (1987) and on a slightly more techni- cal level by Çambel (1993). 4.3 Objectives logically ordered A formal analysis of vegetation dynamics can be built around different objectives. These include the iden- 6 Here a scale-independent descriptive term for vegetation dynamics.</page><page sequence="10">90 He &amp; Orlóci: Anderson Pond revisited tification of the functional form of the process (about which the contents of this paper revolve), the dis- covery of the underlying causes, and the prediction of future states under specific scenarios of change in the causal factors. Why start with a definition of the func- tional form of the process? Simply, because a reasoned search for causes cannot proceed without it. 4.4 A complex view of the vegetation process The central proposition in our conceptualization of vegetation dynamics is that it behaves in a chaotic manner (Anand &amp; Orlóci 1997). In such a dynamics determinism and randomness entwine with one another, with one or the other being the dominant characteristic in alternating phases. Determinism for- ces upon the overall process direction, while random- ness opens up the process to innovations by chance choices of composition. The extreme phases of the process are clearly manifested in Fig. 3. The straight trajectory segments are under dominant linear deter- minism, while the much convoluted non-linear seg- ments, which bring to mind some of Lorenz's (1963) phase space behaviour, identify the effect of dominant randomness. This type of phase structure finds an analogue in the "moving" Markov chain (Orlóci &amp; Orlóci 1988, Orlóci, Anand &amp; He 1993, Anand &amp; Orlóci 1997) with transition probabilities distorted by very small random effects incrementally through a very long period length, with explosive qualitative consequences here and there at unexpected points on the time axis. 4.7 What is periodic? We expect the temporal march of vegetation states to show periodicity in the long run. But important to our view on this, periodicity is not likely to come in exact compositional terms. Such periodicity would require backtracking, which as we now know is an unlikely mode of functioning for a complex natural system. We found periodicity in community stability and we suspect it also in other cases of emergent vegetation characteristics. Acknowledgement.

Orlóci We believe that any generalisation about vegetation dynamics predicated upon the assumption of process homogeneity in the relevant geographic domain can- not claim respectability unless one can shown that homogeneity of the assumed kind has in fact existed. The purpose of this Appendix is to describe a method based on graph topology by which geographic process homogeneity can be measured and tested for statistical significance. 1. Process topology and topological similarity We refer to the graph in Fig 3 as "process signature", and define the signature topology of interest as the manner in which the graph twists and turns through reference space. To describe the turning and twisting we assign +, 0, - scores to projections of regularly placed points on the reference axes in this manner: (1) "+" if the point's co-ordinate value is greater than the co-ordinate value of the chronologically following point on the same axis. (2) "0" if the co-ordinate values are identical. (3) "-" if the relation under (1) is reversed. Now if we complete the scoring on all axis for all points, the comparison problem of signatured and sig- nature B reduces to finding a value for CAB = M/(p(s-l)) Given are: M (number of matching scores on all axes), p (number of axes for the graph with the lesser number of reference axes), and 5" (period length in time steps for the graph with the shorter period length). Cab is a similarity measure, comparable among cases. 2. Important conventions 2.1 The comparisons involve graphs of paleopollen from different localities. Observational points (paleorelevés) are given which as a rule are irregularly spaced on the time axis. Yet, comparability requires pairing of the observational points among the graphs. It is therefore necessary to define analytically com- parable time steps. We do this by interpolation on the time axis (not on the sediment horizon dephts). 2.2 Paleopollen density data are infested with "noise" from different sources. To reduce the noise, we pass from density counts to density count rankings. We also undertake a further cautionary step by setting % numerical limits on the rankings. With limits set, two rankings will be deemed identical (0 score assigned) when the broader limits include the point with the nar- rower limits. For example, if the ranking of a pollen density count is 12 and if the ranking of the next pollen density count in chronological succession on the same axis is 10, and if we set 25% limits, then the two rank- ings will be deemed equal. 2.3 We compare graphs defined in different reference systems. The fact that there is no necessary one to one</page><page sequence="12">92 He &amp; Orlóci: Anderson Pond revisited relationship of the axes of the different reference sys- tems raises the problem of identifying an axis in the reference system of graph B to be paired with a given axis in the reference system of graph A. We use a simple resolution, requiring inspection of a correlation matrix for local maxima. 2.4 Pollen spectra do not have identical period lengths. The comparison must therefore be limited to the com- mon period, starting with a common early state, say period 69, and covering the rest of the period up to present. The direction in which the comparison proceeds does not matter here as long as it is consis- tent. 3. A simulated example We give three graphs in Figure Al for which Table Al holds the co-ordinates (simulated paleopollen den- sities). The comparisons rely on "+, 0, -" scores. We compare the three graphs in pairs: A with B, A with C, and B with C. The pairing of axes is {YAi YBi } and {Ya2 YB2} for A and Ä, { YAi YC2} and {YA2 Ya} for A and C, and {Ybi Yc2} and {YB2 Ya} for B and C. The choice of pairs is consistent with local maxima in the correlation matrix: Ybi YB2 Yci YC2 Yai .943 -.082 .429 .657 YA2 -.054 .390 -.163 -.217 YBI .371 .771 YB2 -.861 .290 'ii-r. : v, ^ X 3 Figure Al. Signatures of the dynamic process in fictitious sites A, B, C. The co-ordinate sets are in Table Al. Labels 1,2,... identify time steps from present to past. The topological similarity of graphs A,B is computed from data in columns 2, 6 and columns 4, 8 in Part b of Table Al . We note that M = 8, p = 2 and s = 6, and that for these, C^b = 0.8 or 80 %. The complete set of similarity values and associated probabilities (a) are the following: Site pairs: AB AC BC C 0.80 0.50 0.50 a 0.09 0.64 0.64 The "C" values tell us how great is the topological similarity of the graphs on a 0 to 1 scale. The probabilities (a) measure the chances of getting a "C" value at least as large as the observed value under the assumption of process homogeneity among the sites. We used randomisation experiments, based on 1000 iterations to determine the a values. The common ran- dom expectation of C is 0.52 and its variance is 0.030. To illustrate further the method, we set 25% tolerance limits on the rankings and compute a new set of results: Site pairs: A, B A,C B, C C 0.70 0.40 0.20 a 0.084 0.608 0.924 Clearly, graphs A and B now appear somewhat less similar, but still their similarity is unusually high in probability terms. The dissimilarity of A or B with C is now increased. The common random expectation of the topological similarity values declined to 0.40 but the variance remained more or less the same (0.0313). 4. Example from the NAP data base We are using 5 real and one fictitious paleopollen sites. The real data come from the North American Pollen Database (Grimm 1993). Data set for the fictitious site is simulated under the assumption of random composi- tional transitions.

We needed to set 25% limits on the rankings to suppress the noise effectively. Interestingly, the limits do not enhance the appearance of topological similarity when the transitions are random (see columns headed by an R in the column label). The following conclusions are in order: 1. In realistic cases, excessive random noise should be expected. This will mask geographic process homogeneity. We suggest therefore the step-by-step incrementing of the limits on the rankings when prob- ing for geographic process homogeneity by our method. 2. Process homogeneity revealed across the sampled geographic domain demolishes the belief that vegeta- tion dynamics has to be (or perhaps ever could be) "in- dividualistic". Vegetation dynamics is in fact a broad geographic phenomenon. In fact, the von Polst (1944) law of regional parallelism is upheld. Table Al.
