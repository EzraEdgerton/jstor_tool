Abstract: In order to reduce the amount of data collection necessary to use the Juhász-Nagy model, the STATIS three-way technique is proposed for pilot analy- ses. The application of STATIS to two spatial processes, yields results approaching very well the synphenetic pattern as obtained by the Juhász-Nagy model. In par- ticular, optimal size of plots can be identified, corresponding to one extreme of the second interstructure axis. In a similar way, the trajectories of plots along the spatial process, as they are represented on the first two principal components of the compromise result, show maximum distances from the center corresponding to maximum associatimi. 1. Introduction The analysis of plant communities, once it aims at a detailed investigation of spa- tial pattern, must take into account the way data were collected (Podani 1984a). Whereas in phytosociological surveys the relevé size is itself dependent on the species identification process in the field (Cochran, 1977), in a study where the details of the joint association of species in the sampling units are relevant, the size of the plots is an independent variable that can actually bias the results of the survey (Juhász-Nagy 1976). In fact, it is evident that a very small plot size would allow only one species to be present at a time, and on the opposite a too large plot is</page><page sequence="2">84 likely to contain all the species of the community, both giving no information as to the actual spatial pattern of the community. Notwithstanding the evidence of the problem, poor attention has been paid in plant community studies to the determination of an optimal sampling design (apart from the randomness requirements necessary for inferential purposes) so that * surveys usually utilize empirically determined plot sizes. Among the few others (Matthews 1978, 1979, Kobayashi 1981), the works of Juhász-Nagy (1963, 1967, 1968, 1976, 1984) and the Hungarian school (Juhász-Nagy and Podáni 1983, Podáni 1984a, b, Bartha and Horváth 1987, Bartha 1990, Gergely 1990) seem to be the most interesting to be used in practice, since a detailed theory is developed and computer programs are available based on such theory. Unfortunately, the application of the Juhász-Nagy model requires examination of many sampling units for determining the characteristic areas of a community. In addition, it seems difficult to use these results for subsequent surveys, since they appear a 5 means of comparison among communities rather than operational tools. In fact, computer simulations are used in order to replace tedious field work (Podani ♦ 1984b, Bartha and Horváth 1987). The aim of this paper is to suggest an exploratory technique for forecasting, or at least approaching, the behavior of the Juhász-Nagy model and showing the change of data structure due to the spatial process associated with the increase of plot size. In this way, a pilot study with small sample size can be helpful in the determination of the optimal plot size to be used in subsequent surveys. 2. Theory 2.1. The Juhász-Nagy model Information statistical functions were proposed by Juhász-Nagy (1976, 1984) to describe basic coenological phenomena, such as preference, diversity and re- semblance. A spatial process is understood as an increase of the size of plots, or</page><page sequence="3">85 other successive changes associated with real or conceptual spaces (Podani 1984a). Mathematical functions based on Shannon's entropy function analyze the scale of synphenetic pattern and characteristic areas are defined in terms of the maxima and minima of these functions, i.e., florula diversity y local distinctiveness and ass oc la- tum. " Optimal" plot sizes are considered as those corresponding to these maxima. Considering a binary coenological table of s species occurring in m sampling units, two couples of marginals can be taken into account: local marginals , namely the number of plots where each species is either present (valences) or absent (inva- lences) and floral marginals, that is the number of species either present or absent in each plot. These marginal distributions are estimated by weighted entropy func- tions increasing (floral and local valences) or decreasing (floral and local invalences) monotonously in the spatial process (i.e., with increasing plot size). These func- tions, as a quartet of "species-area curves" reflect the changes of commonnes-rarity relations and the saturation of plots with species (Bartha 1990). Their extremal points include a characteristic interval, a class of sizes where all the important characteristic points (i.e., the maxima of the characteristic functions) lie. Within the characteristic interval can be taken the most reasonable sampling (Juhász-Nagy 1984). The florula diversity of a sample consisting of m plots is given by 2' mH {A, B, S) = mlogm - ^ /fclog/fc Jt=i where A,By..,S are the s species of the community, /* is the number of quadrats having the A;-th combination of species (florula). k ranges from 1 to 2s, the number of possible combinations of s species. It can be shown that florula diversity is in fact the joint entropy of species*, since the equality holds: mî [A, 1 5, ..., S) = mÈ(L) - mH [A, B, S) where mI(A&gt;B , ..., 5) is the associatimi, the estimate of association or mutual infor- mation, and mff(L) is the local distinctiveness of species, the "total information"</page><page sequence="4">86 or pooled entropy of the table (see Juhász-Nagy and Podani 1983, and Bartha and Horváth 1987, for more details). 2.2. Correspondence analysis Among the many multidimensional scaling procedures currently used in data analysis (see Camiz 1988, 1990b), Correspondence Analysis (CA, Benzécri 1973, Lebart et al. 1977) seems to fit the best to community data. In fact, CA is par- ticularly suited for contingency table analysis, and in addition it is sufficiently ro- bust in respect of the well-known Guttman (or horse-shoe) effect. Actually, it can be shown that CA can be considered both as a particular Principal Coordinates Analysis (Gower 1966), thus enjoying the ability of evaluating explained variance, "interpreting" the axes, etc., and a particular Canonical Analysis (Lebart et al. 1977, Gittins 1985), where different sets of variables (species cover in sample plots, sampled abundance of species) are used in order to describe the same phenomenon, in our case community pattern. Based on the so-called chi-square distance which can be defined on data table rows as «'■a-tètë-fc)*. and on columns as it can be shown that CA corresponds to the eigenanalysis of the symmetric resem- blance matrix the double adjustment to both table margins being considered effective in robustness (Orlóci 1978, Fewster and Orloci 1983). As an extension of CA, Multiple Correspondence Analysis j(MCA) must be mentioned (Benzécri 1973, Lebart et ?1. 1977): in MCA several contingency tables, based on the same individuals can be considered at the same time.</page><page sequence="5">87 2.8. The STATĪS technique The STATĪS technique was proposed by Escoufier (1973, 1980) and further developed by Glaçon (1981), Foucart (1983) and Lavit (1988). It is a three-way multivariate technique capable of analyzing simultaneously different data tables based on the same units, so that it can show the evolution of the different tables due to the third dimension effects. Although this dimension is usually time, STATIS has been used successfully for comparisons among association coefficients by Camiz (1989, 1990a), as suggested by Escoufier (1980). The advantage of STATIS is its ability to compare the different data tables as a whole, considered as different studies to be represented as points in a Euclidian space, and to derive a mean (a compromise study) to project as well on suitable Euclidean spaces for both variables and units, as they aire seen by the different studies, thus allowing an actual representation of the evolution of both variables and units due to the third dimension that distinguishes the studies. The STATIS technique is based on a similarity measure among cases as com- puted in each data table X*, k = I...K (each study, in Escoufier terms). Given a case weights diagonal matrix D (usually the identity matrix), and centered vari- ables weights diagonal matrices M* (one for each table, usually mak = l/tff*), the inverse of each variable's variance, = 0 if % ^ j, the similarity semi-definite positive matrix among cases in each study is defined as From Wfc, operators W*D result, these are comparable, since the cases are the same all over the studies. As a resemblance measure among operators COW (WfcD, WfcD) = Tr( WfcDWfcD) or RV (WfcD, 1 WhD) ; = 1 WhD) ; (Tr(WfcD)2rr(WfcD)2)</page><page sequence="6">88 can be considered, giving a scalar products matrix C that corresponds to either variance-covariance or correlation matrices among variables in the ordinary statis- tics. The eigenanalysis of matrix C leads to a representation of studies by eigen- vectors like in ordinary principal components analysis, the coordinates of studies being the components of eigenvectors normalized to the associated eigenvalues. Such an analysis, named intersctructure by Escoufier, allows a representation of the studies on planes, as well as sin overall comparison. Since both the rows and columns of C can be centered, i.e. the matrix C* = (I - ll'P)C(I - Pll') can be used instead of C, where I is the identity matrix, 1' = (1, 1, ...1) and P is the matrix of weights for studies (usually I), a centered representation can be obtained, where distances among studies are the same. In addition, since the elements of C are all non-negative, Frobenius theorem ensures that the first eigenvector components have the same sign, that can be chosen positive, and let be a' = (ai...a^) the first standardized eigenvector of C, a' a = 1. The matrix WD, where K W = £&lt;*fewfc k= 1 is semi-definite positive, since it is a linear combination of W*D-s, all being positive semi-definite matrices. It is called the compromise matrix and its norm being the first eigenvalue, it summarizes most of W*D. It is by means of the compromise matrix that all variables and the cases, can be simultaneously represented in what is called infrastructure . Let us consider the metric matrix M of pooled variables, as composed by in principal compo- nents analysis of WD, with metric M, let A be the diagonal matrix of decreasing eigenvalues of WD, and Y the matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigen- vectors, normalized by A. Here, a simultaneous representation of all variables is given by X'DYA1^2' and individual trajectories through the studies are given by the columns of W^DYA"1.</page><page sequence="7">89 3. Materials and methods Two kinds of objects were considered: data set A was obtained from a survey in a sand grassland near Bugac, Kiskunság National Park, Hungary, in a stand of Fcstucetum vaginatat holoschotnttosum, as described in Gergely (1990). This is a closed, physiognomically homogeneous community established in the depression of the sandy dunes, under semiarid climatic conditions. Data set B was derived from a study performed close to the Montedimezzo MAB reserve in Molise, Italy (Blasi et al. 1988); a clearing where a reforestation process is in progress, described by the authors as belonging to Mtsobromion , in a wooden area (where Fagus sylvatica and Querctis ctrris axe dominant species), having mesotermic climate, at an elevation- of 925 m. For data set A, binary (presence/absence) data were collected along a 100 m transect obtained by random walking within the studied area (about 14 m2). The ñorula of each 10x10 cm contiguous quadrat along the transect was recorded (1000 quadrats). For our purposes, we limited the data to the ten most abundant species, whose list and textura! data are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

(1988). The original linear cover measure of the ten most abundant species was transformed into presence/absence scores of species, in order to have the same data type as in data set A. The list and textural data of the ten species are shown in Table 2. Both data sets were submitted to Juhász-Nagy's model through the PAT- PRO C program (Bartha and Horvath, 1987) in order to evaluate the characteristic functions, by extracting 300 and 64 plots, respectively. Then, ten units were selected at random along both transects and a spatial process was performed by lengthening the sampling units, as suggested by Bartha and Horváth (1987). Twenty spatial steps were performed in this way for data set A, by enlarging the 10x10 quadrats 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, 50, 64, 80, 100, 128, 200, 300, and 400 times,</page><page sequence="9">91 and 16 for data set B, from 1 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 40, 50, 64 times, thus obtaining two three-way data matrices of size 10x10x20 and 10x10x16, respectively. Both matrices were then reduced, in order to withdraw the last two tables that were constant, all species being present in all quadrats, and a third wa s removed from the data set A, because of memory limitations in the programs; a small variation (1%) in some data was introduced at random in order to avoid null variance species (those either absent in one table or present in every quadrat of a table) that would stop the program running. The 17 data tables of data set A were first submitted to Correspondence Anal- ysis (CA) using ter Braak's (1988) CANOCO program, in order to have an idea of how the results of this method vary over the different tables. Then both three-way matrices were submitted to STATIS procedure. In both cases two eigenvectors were considered sufficient in the complete procedure for a suitable representation of the variation of studies. 4. Results Figures 1-2 and 3-4 show the result of analyzing synphenetic pattern for data sets A and B, respectively, according to the Juhász-Nagy model. Marginal entropy functions, referring to the marginal uncertainty of a binary table, substitute the classical "spec ies- area" functions. The interval of scale, where the approximate equalities are satisfied, includes all the important characteristic points that may be of interest in plant community studies. In the spatial process defined for data set A (Figs. 1 and 2) all these items are clearly represented, the characteristic interval ranging from the 1st to the 9th steps, corresponding to 1 to 16 sampling units. Within this interval, maximum areas of both florula diversity and local distinctiveness occur at a plot of 3 units, and the maximum area of associatimi occurs at plot size of 4 units. These areas represent the community in its richest and most diverse development. In other words, here the species are most distinctive among plots (the maximum of local distinctiveness); the chance that two plots have the same species is the minimum</page><page sequence="10">92 Figure 1.

That is, the optimum sample plot size ranges between 300 and 400 cm2. Whereas the description of synphenetic pattern for data set A is sufficiently complete (even if no information is provided for the theoretical initial steps of the spatial process) , that of data set B seems much more limited on the left side of the graph: the characteristic interval is partially represented (only the second step of the process can be considered as an upper limit, i.e., 40 cm). Not even the maxima of the characteristic functions seem to be represented, since the chosen plot size is likely to be too large for analyzing this community. Nevertheless, these limits of the data will also demonstrate the ability of STATIS procedure in the representation of the submitted spatial process. As seen in Table 3, CANOCO extracted up to four factors for the first 11 tables, then two for table 12, three for tables 14-16, and finally only one for the last two tables. The decrease of eigenvalues is in this case an indication of the diminishing correspondence between species' and plots' distribution, whereas the decreased number of eigenvalues corresponds to the increase of the similarity among both plots and species. In fact, increasing the plot size causes more species to be present in all plots, and more plots tend to include all species. On the opposite, at the beginning of the series two or one species, or one plot, are missing because no presence resulted in the table. The number of different locations in the scattergrams occupied by species or plots can indicate the diversity of the analyzed table. In this respect, tables corresponding to steps 4, 5, and 6 of the spatial process seem to be more useful than the others, but there is no evidence of a "better" plot size among these three. In fact, the fourth one corresponds to the max. of associatum, but no suggestion of it comes from the graphical representations. The results of STATIS procedure are of more interest for both cases. Two ma- jor eigenvalues were extracted both in non-centered and in centered interstructure analysis, accounting for more than 60% of total variance in each case; for data set</page><page sequence="13">95 Table 3« Correspondence analysis on the spatial process for tables of data set A.

The quality of representation of' the different dimensions on the plane of two eigenvectors is various: in data set A, in non centered analysis 14 tables are very well represented, the first and the last three of the spatial process having a poor representation. In centered analysis, only the three last tables are represented badly. In data set. B only the last table is represented poorly in non centered analysis, all the rest having a sufficient or very good representation. This can be explained by the low variance of the extreme plot size tables. This is already an element of interest that can contribute to the determination of studies to be considered as extremes.</page><page sequence="14">96 Figure 5.

In the centered analysis (Figs. 6 and 8) they are at the extremes of the first axis, opposite to points where the null information tables can be expected, i.e., those having all species absent or present, considered as limiting tables of the series. The analysis of compromise tables depicts two high eigenvalues in both analy- ses, corresponding to 26.62% and 19.96% of total variance for data set A, and 43.81 and 19.95% for data set B. On the plane of two eigenvalues, the trajectories of both species and plots along the spatial process are oriented towards the extremes of the graph at the beginning, then returning backwards to the center.

Discussion The definition of characteristic areas and functions of a community needs a large number of sampling plots of continuously increasing size (Juhász-Nagy, 1976). Actually, it was shown by Bartha and Horváth (1987) that a computer simulated spatial process, obtained by lengthening the plots along a transect, can help in the reduction of the amount of data to be collected. Nevertheless, difficulties arise when a transect sampling is not considered suitable, and the simulated process of C'C S ļ * I I</page><page sequence="22">104 successive enlargements may not be used. On the other side, characteristic functions and areas as computed on the basis of the ten sample plots of data set A are highly biased and unpredictable, especially if compared to those based on a sample of 300 quadrats. The results of a classical exploratory technique, such as Correspondence Anal- ysis, are of limited interest for comparative purposes. Also, any other two-way multidimensional scaling technique would not perform better, since the comparison of results of different data tables cannot give evidence of a process that develops outside each table. Even considering all data tables as a whole with Multiple Cor- respondence Analysis, would not give better results. At best, trajectories of either plots or species along the spatial process (but not both) could have been resulted. The correspondence between the graphs provided by the Juhász-Nagy model and the STATIS procedure, where the studies pertaining to optimal plot sizes are situated in a clearly defined position of the planes, is of highest interest. In fact, the pattern of studies on the interstructure planes, even if distorted by the arch effect, "remembers" the pattern of local distinctiveness as represented in the Juhász-Nagy model. In addition, the trajectories of both species and plots on interstructure show clearly how the diversity of both species and plots is influenced by the spatial process. Particularly interesting is the case of data set B, collected without aiming at this kind of survey. Although the initial part of the process was uncovered by the data collection, including the maxima of the characteristic functions, the interstructure configuration repeats the rest of the series the same way as for data set B, the "open" shape of spatial process and trajectories corresponding to the missing tables. Such an effect is a good indication of the different influence that studies applying small and large plot sizes have on the compromise matrix. As a consequence, it can be stated that the number of steps of the spatial process, particularly the size intervals between tables pertaining to large sizes, is of minor importance. Thus, one can</page><page sequence="23">105 expect that a complete spatial process, starting from very small plot size, would be represented in a similar way, giving useful information on the determination of optimum plot size, based on the studies of small plots most distant from compromise in non-centered analysis, and/or the one opposite to the null information studies in centered analysis. The loss of correspondence, between species position on compromise axes and the local entropy of species, depends on the difference of results, if entropy computa- tions are performéd on the same sample of ten plots (in which case a correspondence is acknowledged, but results are distorted) and on a larger sample that is consid- ered more suitable for that purpose. In fact, if reduced samples are sufficient to describe the evolution of the spatial process, and represent the trajectories for ten plots accordingly, it is well known that model measures must be evaluated using large samples in order to be effective (Juhász-Nagy 1976, 1984). 6. Conclusions The results provided by the STATIS procedure seem to be very helpful for representing a spatial process. In fact, the correspondence between the characteris- tic functions and both the position of tables in the interstructure analysis and the pattern of plot trajectories show that STATIS results can give highly predictable information on the Juhász-Nagy model. Further comparative studies should verify the robustness of the STATIS procedure in respect of both the number of steps and the interval between steps of the spatial process. A comparison in a wooden area could as well be useful in the determination of the range of application of the pilot study in advance of a more complete and difficult survey. Experiments on actual (i.e., not simulated) spatial processes may also contribute to the verification of the effectiveness of the method.</page><page sequence="24">106 7.
