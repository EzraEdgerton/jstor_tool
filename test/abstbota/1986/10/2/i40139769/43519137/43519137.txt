Clustering methods and principal coordinates analysis were applied to characterize vegetation pattern and to reveal trends of temporal variation. The results indicate a tendency of forming a new stable state rather than the recovery of the pre-distur bance state of the community. The multivariate techniques demonstrate that the different coenostates developed after the treatments were more or less sensitive to drought and were much influenced by the amount of herbicide applied. The expression of seasonality is also apparent especially in the ordinations. It must be noted that pure seasonal fluctuations can be detected unambiguously only in the intact community. In some treated plots, seasonal changes are also present but less clear, and in the other cases they cannot be distinguished at all from regeneration and other processes. Principal coordinates analysis reveals underlying trends in vegetation dynamics and facilitates the interpretation of factors primarily responsible for the changes. The first two axes seem to correspond to fluctuations in the control experiment or a secondary successional trend initiated by herbicide treatment, whereas the third axis reflects either seasonality or dry periods in the climate. It is concluded that the joint application of classification and ordination methods is very useful in detecting vegetational changes. The analyses confirm the findings obtained previously by different similarity indices and provide new information as to the "group-structure" of the sampling units and the temporal trajectories throughout the study.</page><page sequence="2">318 I. INTRODUCTION In a semi-natural, species-rich perennial grassland community, major floristic changes induced by herbicides selective to dicots and monocots and by herbicides of total effects were studied in permanent plots. The effectiveness of different similarity matrices in detecting vegetation dynamical changes has been reported earlier (Viràgh 1986). In that paper I analyzed the effect of treatments on the coenological similarity relations, the direction of secondary succession, the rates of change measured as floristic change and as change of species cover (Bornkamm 1981, Armesto and Pickett 1986), the degree of recovery of the community ("resilience" cf. Holling 1973, Harrison 1976, Rejmánek 1979, LepŠ et al. 1982, Kindlman and LepŠ 1985), the seasonal dynamics and the responses to stress situation (drought, "resistance" cf. LepŠ et al. 1982). This paper presents the results of cluster analyses and ordinations which may indicate other aspects of vegetation dynamics. It is examined whether the classification and ordination methods are appropriate to reveal the pattern of vegetational changes and to provide information not apparent otherwise . The main objectives of this study are: - to reveal the group structure of points of time of sampling, - to analyze the distinction between stages before and after disturbance (sensu Grime 1979, White 1979, Sousa 1984, Rykiel 1985), - to detect trends during the five years of study. II. MATERIAL AND METHODS II . 1 . Field experiments The research program was launched in 1979 and the experiments ran for 5-6 years in a fairly stable Pulòatillo- T e.òtuce.tum /iup¿co¿ae. community. A homogeneous stand of this old community was selected for studies of local secondary succession</page><page sequence="3">319 Table 1. A summary of experiments and vegetational changes. Treatment Disturbance pr°ces® Treatment effects after treatment Control All changes are attributable only to background effects. The dicots , the less dominant group, were killed. Immediately after Gabonil chronic regeneration spraying, there was a possibility for expansion of grasses and later for the re-settlement of some dicots All monocots were killed leading to large spots of bare ground on which some dicots well spreading by Dalapon chronic regeneration vegetative propagula became predominant and determined subsequent vegetation changes. The monocots reappeared some years later The above-ground plant parts are destroyed. In the secondary local succession, a rapid vegetative Gramoxone acute secondary regeneration from almost entirely succession bare ground was decisive in determining the direction and the rate of change of re-colonization in the study sites. Glyphosate killed the vegetation completely, including the above- ground and the under-ground plant parts, but did not affected the seeds in the soil. The bare ground was recolonized entirely from seeds, local therefore this process can be Glyphosate acute secondary considered a relatively typical succession secondary succession of an old grassland community. In the area after the treatment, the first species occupying the site were mainly dicots, but a few monocots also sprouted. The dominance of dicots was obvious through the whole period investigated. This is an experimental study of Sterilized primary primary succession. It reflects a soil succession certain replacement series of species groups.</page><page sequence="4">320 and regeneration processes initiated by some herbicide treatments (Virágh 1982, 1986). The experiments carried out are briefly summarized in Table 1. 11. 2. Sampling The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with fire replications per treatment (a total of 40 plots). The 2 detailed investigations were carried out in 1*1 m permanent quadrats covered with a grid of 20*20 cm2 units (see Virãgh 1982, for details). The floristic composition was recorded twice a year, in June and September. The percentage cover of species was estimated in the contagious subquadrats (a total of 125 subquadrats per treatment ) . The area was sprayed at one occasion at the end of June (Viragh 1982), except for the two selective herbicides of larger dose, which were applied again after a year ("repeated chronic disturbance" cf. Grime 1979, Westman and O'Leary 1986). The chemical composition and doses of leaf-herbici 3, as well as the dates of spraying and data collection are sh in Table 2. 11. 3. Data The presence/absence and cover scores were summarized in species by subquadrats data matrix for each point of time an each treatment. Such a matrix represents the operational unit (basic object) of multivariate analysis. For example, in the control experiment 99 species were detected, so that ten 99*125 data matrices were obtained. To facilitate the use of resemblance coefficients for comparing points of time, these matrices were transformed into vector form. Thus, in the control experiment the starting matrix for clustering and ordination had 12375 rows and 10 columns. Consequently, only the temporal change within subquadrats is manifested in the final results, variation between the 5 replicate plots does not influence ordinations and classifications.</page><page sequence="5">321 W 4-» O d) 4H &lt;+-4 (U T- I (0 U •H 00 o rH O •H CO &gt;n XZ CX u •H &lt;D s: 4-&gt; *0 G Cd W 4-1 e 0) E 4-) CO 0) V-t 4-» rH CO U •H e 0) XZ u 4-1 O CO E E P CO &lt; CM &lt;U T- I J=&gt; CO H 0) 4J X3 •H «H .43 CO O • "H -H (0 • C U SÌ CO I •oo -h 4h e &lt;u a o •H -H O -H 4-&gt; XZ C W U CO &lt;0 Z&gt; -H CU 4H CO -H 4H Ē C 'C) c C e •o ° , &gt; ° w o c d) c &gt;, c c3 •H u , -H .H -H (0 x: O OT O O &lt;U 'H T3 « d) H-M4J o •H T34J J5 T3 X&gt; O (0 CO O W ,H CO -H X» •p1&lt;ü!~^t? -H -H XI -O T3 £ 4-1 rH 4-» 4-&gt; H *7Í * O CX CO CO -H 4-1 O &gt;&gt; U (0 d) -H Q) (I) O -H -H 4-1 Ih O C d) • XZ d) • Ē •C -û rH u i- i o oo io io «h co ex meo o »-« O 00 co U Ē d) CX 4-14-1 o 4H 4-&gt; J_i 4H (U TD V-4 O Cl) d) -o o a&gt; O 1^1 d) o Cd O x: C (fl CH X3JCZC4H oo o ^ . 1 .. -H rH -H ^ I 4-&gt; d) -H O - -H rH » -H d) ^ C . 4-10)33 .. 4-) 0) x: E a&gt;*Oj3 d&gt; "O .C O (0 O« d) 00 (O O (0 CO 4-í c9 CO x3 O "O 4-&gt; •H 0) &gt;.JC Û) 0) VH 0) CU 4-&gt; -H «H T3 -H "O 4-&gt; i- I 4-&gt; 4-&gt; Ih &gt;H -M rH O C0 O CO O C CO UC OT y IM4J «ÜCEOTa)¿)&lt;Ü.HC0 O O O C 4J CO .Hfl" UC OT CO a) C CO -H -H O (1) d. d) CO 4-&gt; 4-&gt; JZ Xi »H X&gt; -H CO &gt; -H rH i- I -H &gt;&gt;&gt;P'HOC0a)4J »h CO jQ U CO X&gt; -H ^ ° ''l 4-ł3CXa»EO 3 SJ X § *« ■H4JrHrH&lt;U+-&gt;CC 0)4-» -H d) 4-» -H CO ° 4-ł3CXa»EO 4-1 I 4H O 4H -H -H &gt;"» Xi O XZ JZ O r- O) UCOXOM^ ÜC(3ÍIHHQ)(0 IO e IO CjC 0) G) -H d) 3 O &lt;0 d) "H -H (0 CO -H 4-&gt; 4H O «H UH O -H 4-» Q. rH 4-) -a C 4J i-iX4-&gt;OOd)(OC coc c ¿1 S .UĒ 5 d)34-&gt;d)4JC0»-,J3 CU O 4-1 d)0 4-) &gt;, H CO C0 hH -H C0 6 OO COhH B H 4-1 CX 4-&gt; JE »-t .-JE l-H C0 co • m oovt^-Nsr^ ^ ^ co ^ m v-c 4-» co ^ c 00 COCO 10 00 co 00 en ooeo ooeo co co ex on O -H On Jh On Ut ON M On Ih On ł-i V-t On d) (D O H *T3 H (0 r-l (0 H (0 H (0 H (0 H (0 rH &gt;, CO 4-» co łn i d* id&gt; id)id) id) id) i d) O ON On &gt;.

Classifications The objects in each treatment were classified by means of 12 different agglomérat i ve hierarchical methods. Possible combinations of three sorting algorithms (furthest neighbor, group average and sum of squares agglomeration or Ward's method) and 8 resemblance coefficients (Stfrensen index, Russell-Rao index, chord distance and Euclidean distance for binary data, as well as Czekanowski .index, the product moment correlation coefficient, chord distance and Euclidean distance for cover data) were used. All results are not evaluated in this paper, those based on the Czekanowski index and furthest neighbor or group average sorting were selected for demonstrating the classifications. To describe the heterogeneity in fusion similarities, measures of dispersion were calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean of fusion levels. I suggest that the values obtained in this way are indicative of the sharpness of group structure. 11. 5. Ordinations The same matrices subjected to clustering were analyzed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) to reveal underlying trends in vegetational changes. From the principal coordinates, Euclidean distances between the objects were also calculated, and then the distance matrices constructed by this way were further evaluated by Ward's sorting algorithm. These clusters were superimposed onto the ordination results (Figs 7-11). The cluster analyses and ordinations were carried out by* programs NCLAS and PRINCOOR of the SYN-TAX II package (Podani 1984). The impact of data type, data standardization, resemblance function and algorithm on the classifications and ordinations of objects will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.</page><page sequence="7">323 III. RESULTS AND THEIR DISCUSSION III. 1. A summary of earlier results For a better understanding of the results presented here, it is necessary to summarize the main conclusions of a previous paper on this subject (Viràgh 1986). In the intact community (control experiment) similarity values are relatively high and fluctuate within a narrow range. The rates of change from one sampling date to the other can be considered fairly low (20-30%) showing that the original, untreated community is in dynamically stable state. During the 5 years of study, the changes referred to the first sampling date show a special declining tendency (similarity values decrease by 10%) induced mainly by the differences between years. Seasonal fluctuations can be very well detected and distinguished rather sufficiently from a main trend. The species rich community has been proved to be resistant to drought, but its recovery following disturbance was weak. Herbicides cause considerable changes in the grassland community which can regenerate very slowly after being drastically displaced from the initial stable state. In fact, the community could not recover its original state within 5 years . GABONIL EXPERIMENTS The herbicide spraying caused significant changes in the floristic composition by strongly reducing the species number. The rates of cover-based changes are lower than those of floristic composition and the rates in the control experiment. The behaviour of the coenostates* after disturbance was * Coenostate is understood here as a state with some floristic composition at a given time. The term "community" is not equally used for this, because the species composition of coenostates changes very rapidly. A community can be characterized by well-defined floristic composition permanent in time, as well as by high degree of organization and great extent of "self -reproduction" . It is not true for coenostate from any respect.</page><page sequence="8">324 determined by the monocots, like in the intact community. The fluctuations are mainly caused by the presence/ absence of the reappearing dicots, which are greatly influenced by seasonality; whereas the changes in cover values of the predominant grasses are negligible. The drought effects, although slight, are detectable in the values of Stensen (1948) and Czekanowski (1909) indices. Four-five years after the treatment, the coenostates seem to reach a new stable state when smaller dose of Gabonil was used. In case of larger dose, where reinvasion by the dicots was restricted, the plots could not regain the state preceding the repeated disturbance either and even further decrease in similarity to the first sample could be observed later . DALAPON EXPERIMENTS Coenostates of the plots after spraying, characterized mainly by the dicots throughout the five years, proved to be very sensitive and unstable. The rates of change between two subsequent sample times are very rapid, and much faster than in all other experiments. The response to drought is the most prominent. The stress situation caused drastic differences in similarity relations. The coenostates have no resistance, but due to the flexibility of dominant dicots they can regenerate. The effect of seasonality, suppressed mainly by vegetative régénérât ional processes, cannot be recognized here. In the course of secondary succession, in the Gramoxone and Glyphosate experiments rates of change are very rapid at the beginning of the process and rapid later. In the Gramoxone experiment after the early regeneration phase, the coenostate differing in 35-50% from the original state, (according to Stfrensen and Czekanowski indices) cannot change further on. It is due to the fact that first of all vegetative regeneration takes place and species cover completely the bare ground in a relatively short time, thus hindering further changes. The direction of changes in the Glyphosate plots may be considered convergent. The changes are so rapid that they generally</page><page sequence="9">325 suppress the seasonality. The effects of drought can be recognized rather clearly . EXPERIMENT ON STERILIZED SOIL During the primary succession, the rates of change are very rapid and rapid in the first three years studied. In the last two years, the time to time changes decrease to 20-30%. Whereas the floristic and cover-based composition shows relatively little changes, the similarities to the first sample within the study period progressively decreased below 5-10% indicating extremely great deviations. The effects of seasonality, which were rather suppressed by the process of succession, could not be reflected here. The effects of drought are well demonstrated because of the sensitive responses of the given composition. Some specific features and the main differences between the experiments are demonstrated in Table 3. III. 2. Results of cluster analysis Control experiment (Fig. 1) Three groups can be distinguished. In the last three years, fusions between summer-summer and autumn-autumn sampling dates on high similarity levels are peculiar. The high values of the Czekanowski index remain within a narrow range and there are small distances between the fusion levels showing homogeneity of the whole data matrix. The dendrograms of the treated plots are entirely different from the control ones. Gabonil experiments (Fig. 2) A sharp distinction between the first sampling date and all the other is obvious. The similarity values between consecutive objects increase; this tendency is typical of secondary successional processes. The different effects caused by lower and higher doses can be well detected in the dendrograms.

The effect of the repeated treatment in 1980 can be reflected in the fusion of the 4th sampling date to another cluster as compared with the Gabonil experiment of lower dose. Fusion levels of consecutive points of time are always higher indicating that temporal cover changes are slower for Gabonil 7 than for Gabonil 4. Dalapon experiments (Fig. 3) In these experiments, there is also a good distinction among the first and all the other points of time. The similarity between the consecutive samples is relatively high, but the fusion similarity between the clusters is low. The hierarchical relationships show larger heterogeneity than those in the control and the Gabonil experiments. The sharp separation of the 8th sample point has to be emphasized. It is the expression of drought effects in 1982, which has not been detected in the control, and only to a small extent in the Gabonil experiments. This sharp separation is much more emphasized than in all the other experiments. Fig. 3.

The main difference between the two experiments is that the separation of the 2nd and the 3rd sample points of time from each other and from all the others is stronger in the Glyphosate than in the Gramoxone experiments. It indicates that the first two coenostates following immediately the herbicide spraying are much more different in the Glyphosate than in the Gramoxone treatment. In both experiments, the distinction of coenostates referring to the autumn of 1982 can be well detected. A tendency of forming groups very sharply separated from one another can be observed only during the primary succession (Experiment on sterilized soil) (Fig. 5). Three discrete clusters can be well distinguished. Fusion levels between the clusters are very low indicating the existence of three different coenostates. Graphical representation of cluster formation based only on furthest neighbor sorting strategy was also applied to make the differences among the treatments and the departures from the control experiment more illustrative and informative. These diagrams (Fig. 6) show the relationship between the subgraphs of the relevés and indicate the levels of similarity at which the clusters are modified by addition of "objects" (Legendre and Legendre 1983). The degree of the effects of different treatments and differences in fusion similarities are well demonstrated by the graphs, as well as by measures of dispersion of fusion levels (Table 4). This value is 15% in the control, 25% in the Gabonil 7, 35% in the Dalapon experiments, and it reaches the value of 50% in the "Sterile soil" experiment indicating the greatest heterogeneity in fusion similarities. When dispersion in fusion levels is high, the existence of distinct groups in the classification space is more likely than when dispersion is low.</page><page sequence="14">330 Fig. 4.

Ordination results The ordination demonstrates: - temporal tra jec tories in floristic composition from 1979 to 1983, distances among the coenostates in the two-dimensional ordination space (expression of "rate of change"), seasonal differences, differences between control and treated plots in both successional trends and seasonal effects, response to extremely dry climatic conditions. The results of PCoA from matrices calculated by the Czekanowski index are illustrated here, using the first three principal coordinates (Figs 7-11). The ordination suggests that the vegetation of each treated plot develops towards a special direction. The separation of control plots from all the treated plots is sharp.</page><page sequence="17">333 Control experiment (Fig. 7) The differences in climatic and seasonal conditions between years are of major significance in determining vegetation dynamics. The ordination of sampling plots ("sampling time") at axes 1 and 2 demonstrates the separation between the first two and the last three years. The first principal axis (reflecting differences predominantly between years) accounting for 22% of the total variance and the second one (reflecting predominantly trend), accounting for 15% seem to correspond to main floristical changes through the years. Axis 3 reflects seasonality in the control experiment, but its interpretation for the other experiments is ambiguous. The herbicide effects are especially important for determining vegetational changes, and generally suppress the manifestation of seasonality . Strong influence of disturbance is reflected by the high "scores" of the first sample point of time on the 1st and the 2nd principal axes, as well as in the long distances between the position of sample times before and after treatments . Gabonil experiment (Fig. 8) In these cases, the direction of changes is similar to those in the control. The first axis, accounting for 22% and 26% of the total variance, respectively, in the different doses, can be interpreted as a "herbicide factor" and the second axis accounting for 19% of the total variance in both cases, seems to be a "regeneration trend" through the years. The ordination results on the first 2 axes show considerable differences in the effects of different doses (see the adjacent position of points 1-2 and 3-4). High rates of change are striking only in the first year (between the first 2 points of time), and then all the plots seem to have reached a balance reflected by the decreasing distances.</page><page sequence="18">334 Fig. 7.

Thus, the biological interpretation of the principal coordinates is also different. The grouping of points of times is well reflected on the first axis, and the changes induced by herbicide treatments are indicated by axis 2. The first axis accounts for 20-22% of the total variance and the second one, as a "herbicide factor", accounts for 16-18% of the total variance. The effects of treatments in these experiments are so significant that the expression of seasonality was not detectable. The changes, if Fig. 9. Principal coordinates ordination of the Dalapon 12 (A) Dalapon 20 (B) points of time (see Fig. 7 for explanations).</page><page sequence="21">337 compared with the Gabonil experiments, are also greater and are reflected by the longer distances between the points of time, as well as in the dispersion of the points over a larger area. On the plane of axes 2 and 3, the distinction of the first point of time, representing the intact pre-treatment state, from the other points is fairly sharp. The response to drought can be detected first of all on the third axis. The isolation of point 8 is very striking. Gramoxone and Glyphosate experiments (Fig. 10) During the secondary succession, trends in vegetation composition through the four years studied are demonstrated well by the ordinaton axes 1 and 2. The first axis accounts for 25% in the Gramoxone and for 24% in the Glyphosate experiments. This axis can be interpreted as one reflecting a secondary successional trend. The second axis, as a "herbicide factor", is less important than the first in both treatments; it accounts for 15% in the Gramoxone and for 20% in the Glyphosate experiment. No seasonality was detected in the first four dimensions . Fig. 10.

Among the first five sample points there are high rates of change, whereas between the last four sample times the changes are slow. The distances between the relevés become also shorter. In the last two years of the investigated period, the vegetation has reached a more stable state, whereas during the early stages of primary succession probably four well- distinguished coenostates replaced one another. The first axis, corresponding to the floristical change, is very important; it accounts for 35% of the total variance. IV. SUMMARY The results of multivariate techniques in this study confirmed the findings obtained by different similarity indices (Virágh 1986). Classifications and ordinations showed that upon the effect of herbicides, the succession tends to a new stable state rather than to the original. The effects of drought and Fig. 11 Principal coordinates ordination of points of time from sterilized soil (see Fig. 7 for explanations).</page><page sequence="23">339 seasonality were also recognizable. It can be stated that the essential (e.g., régénérât ional ) and even other less obvious vegetational changes due, for example, to drought were clearly manifested in the different results. These observations support the view that the groups and trends indicated are not artefacts. Classifications and ordinations showing other aspects of vegetation dynamics provided additional information. Dendrograms reflected well the groups of points of time. Ordinations confirmed the discontinuity of data and revealed temporal tra jec tories through the years and underlying trend s in vegetation dynamics, and made possible the interpretation of factors responsible for the changes. These descriptive analyses yielded meaningful results on the pattern of vegetational changes, but it is also obvious that many questions remain open and additional studies on population dynamics of the species are necessary.
