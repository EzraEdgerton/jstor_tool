Eötvös University, Muzeum krt. 6-8, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary The age-specific population growth models describe the dynamics of the age structure of a population. For the basic properties of the original, disc/iete time-disc/iete age model we refer to Leslie (1945, 1948), and to Usher (1972), and Sverezhev and Logofet (1978) for a more recent survey. There also exists a continuous time -discrete age. version of the model, see e.g., Poluekt ov (1974) and Varga (1984), involving ordinary differential equations, and also a continuous time. -continuo us age variant which, surprisingly, turned out to be relevant in the mathematical realization theory of distributed parameter control systems (see Juhász-Nagy and Varga 1980, Szigeti and Vera 1986a, b). In this paper, the continuous time-disc/iete age version is considered. The model is set up in section 1. In sections 2 and 3, an asymptotic age distribution is obtained, based on the spectral properties of the system matrix. Our treatment is somewhat different from that of Poluektov (1974). In section 4, stability criteria are given in terms of the model parameters. 1 . THE MODEL Let us suppose that the individuals of a population are divided into N£2 age groups. (The length of age intervals may be different.) Denote by xi the number of individuals in age group i as a function of time (i6 1, N) . Suppose that (i) The probability for an individual of age group i to enter the age group i+1 during At is g. At + ď (At) i with some fa &gt; 0 (i£ 1, N - 1 ) ;</page><page sequence="2">358 (ii) the probability for an individual of age group i to leave this group during At is 3±At + ď (At) with some ß_^&gt;0 ( i € 1, N); and (iii) the probability for an individual of age group i to have ou offspring during At is a At + cr( At ) with some a £0 ( i £ 1, N). Clearly, the inequalities fti=ßi(i6: 1, N-l) should hold. From these assumptions, we get a deterministic model of the dynamics of the population in the form of a system of differential equations : xl= (oiļ-$ļ)Xļ+ a2x2+ * * * + aNxN ' *2 = ^lxl~ ^2X2' : (1) XN= ^N-lxN-l"eNxN' In terms of the matrix arß1 a2 •• • "N-l aN y-1 -e2 . . . o o : : ' (2) 0 0 ^N-l _ßN we. have X = Ax. ( 3 ) Since all off-diagonal elements of A are non-negative, it is easy to prove (see Bellman 1960, p. 172.) that, for every initial state x°£R + , x : [O , +°°[-HRN in (3), satisfying the initial condition</page><page sequence="3">359 X ( O ) = x° (4) remains in the positive orthant: x ( t ) £ (R N ( t € [O , + oo [). Notice that, if the division into age groups is uniform (the age intervals are of equal length), then ^ļ=^2= =^N * We also mention an interesting particular case of system (1), applied to the mitotic cell division without extinction (see Zaslavski 1972). Here we consider N=4 age groups corresponding to the following mitotic phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Then, the system matrix (2) is of the following form: "-ßj 0 0 2ß4~~ -ß2 0 0 A = 0 ß2 -ß3 0 0 o ß3 -ß4 This model may also be helpful to present more complicated "biorythmic phases" of cell dormancy, maturation and activity. 2. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM MATRIX Define b: = max^ř^: i £ 1 , N } , and denote by d ( A) the spectrum of A . lk(LO/iQ.m 1 . Suppose that &gt; 0 . Then there exists a A, £d(A)n] - b, + oo[ which is simple, and an eigenvector ° N x 1 £ IR + associated with A ^ , such that, for all A£&lt;^(A)'{Aļļ- y the inequality ReA &lt; A^ holds. Pioo£. Consider the matrix B:= A + bl . Clearly, B is non- negative, and, if yUļ,..., )d^ are the eigenvalues of B (with multiplicity) then - b , ... , -b are the eigenvalues of A (with multiplicity). Furthermore, if x1 is an eigenvector of B associated with , then it is also an eigenvector of A associated with ¿A.</page><page sequence="4">360 The matrix B is irreducible. Indeed, consider the directed graph associated with B: G (B):- [(i, j) fe 1, N X 1, N : b.^ o} . Since » Ï2 » • * • » Xn_i » aN ^ this graph contains the following cycle, V o-&lt; o-^ ^ b 12 3 N Therefore, G(B) is strongly connected which means that B is irreducible (see Varga 1967). To the matrix B we apply the Frobenius theorem on non- negative matrices (Varga 1967). There exists a Mjļ + 00 £ 1 ° N which is simple, and an eigenvector x £R+ of B associated with Mļ such that for all yU€(5(B) we have Ļu I £ . Therefore, Aļi=^-b is a simple eigenvalue of A and X^&gt; -b. Furthermore, for all X£ ¿ (A )' { X^ , from (X + b) € 6(B)'[&gt;uļ"ļ we get ReX + b = Re (X + b)s|X+ bl^ which implies ReX &lt; . Re,ma/ik 1 . Using the special structure of matrix A, a positive eigenvector of A can be expressed in terms of X^ and the elements of A . The eigenvector equation, corresponding to X^ is (ot ļ -3 ļ - X ļ ) x ļ + a 2*2* aNxN = ^lXl " (ß2 + V X2 7 °' *N-1XN-1 " (ßN+Xl)XN ~ °'</page><page sequence="5">361 Hence, taking Xj¡j: = l , we get N-1 o r«. o 3 +X r«. ļļ N-k+1 1 k=l y y 5N-k X1 = (^n-1 ^N-2 ' ^N-l ßN + X! Vi 1 3. THE ASYMPTOTIC AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION For any c&gt;0, the (maximal) solution of the initial value problem (3) - (4) with x°:= ex is X (t) = c e^l x^ ( t € (R ) This means that the population somehow changes (either grows or dies out) proportionally, i.e., the initial proportions of the age groups are preserved. If 1, then x* is an equilibrium state of the population. o N Now, in the general case, if x ē K+ is an arbitrary initial state, we obtain that the equilibrium proportions are asymptotically achieved in the following sense:</page><page sequence="6">362 ° N 7ke.oie,m 2 . Suppose that &lt;*^&gt;0 . Then for any x°6 R+ there exists a c£ 0 such that for the solution of (3) - (4) we have llm = cxl • (5) t-&gt;-oo el P/ioö-f.. Applying Theorem 1, we obtain that the solution in question has the form Xi t , X (t) = c e X + P (t) (telR) where the latter term is a vec tor- valued quasi-polynomial containing exponential terms e^*" only with ReX &lt; X^ , and c6(L. Hence (5) and c Ł 0 are obvious. Re,ma/ik 2 . The condition aM&gt;0 in Theorems 1 and 2 means that N individuals of the last age group are reproductive. This is not really restrictive, because all postrepr oduc t i ve age groups can be left out of the model, without any effect on the preceding age groups. 4. STABILITY PROPERTIES OF THE MODEL First we formulate a necesseary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stability. lhe.o/ie.m 3 . The system (1) is asymptotically stable if and only if «ļ- ßj &lt; o, and for all jfc2, N, ń '-'i n - «21. nv- •••-«, n », &gt; o. Pnoo-ļL . Apply the following result on real matrices with non- negative off-diagonal elements ([l0]): Nx N Suppose that for a matrix A€ IR ? we have 0 (i, j € 1 , N, i t j) . Then, for all Xeò(A) , ReX &lt; 0 if and only if for the principal minors</page><page sequence="7">363 ~all alj~ a . : = J a . , ... a . . _ J . , 1 ... J . J_ . (jè TTÑ) the inequalities ( - l)3 aj&gt;0 ( j Él, N ) hold. Taking advantage of the special structure of the matrix A in (2), we can calculate its corresponding minors by mathematical induction, obtaining j j j j-i a J = (-l)j n ß. k - a, 1 riß. k - ot2ïl^ z ßk R - ••• J lk=l k 1 k=2 k z xk=3 R l7' for all j € 2, N . Hence the statement of Theorem 3 follows. Now we propose another type of stability criterion. For given (3o&gt;0 define the function f:]-30 , + 00 [ -* (R by the equality " J-I f(A):=_2ÍL_ + &gt; _AÍ n*. ' (6) 6.*» + U [. n*. ' lke.o/ie.m 4. Suppose that ot^&gt;0 and 3^= $2 = • • • = &amp;o • (The age intervals are of equal length.) Then, system (1) is (a) asymptotically stable if and only if f(0) &lt; 1, (b) stable but not asymptotically if and only if f(0) = 1, (c) unstable if and only if f(0) &gt; 1. P/ioo£. First we calculate the characteristic equation of A. For all define Pļ (*) := &lt;*1 - ß0 - X</page><page sequence="8">364 and, for j € 2 , N , OLļ- B0 - X a2 a3 . . . a a^. ïj -ß0-X 0 ... 0 0 Pj(X) := 0 ^2 -30-X ... 0 0 0 ^ -B0-X Then, by a mathematical induction similar to that used in the proof of Theorem 3, we get that N-l Pj(A) = (-l)j [ (ß0+X)N -Ojí^+A)""1 -a2^(e0+X)N"2 l' 1 ( je TTÑ), in particular, the normed characteristic polynomial of A is N-l p(X):- (ß0+X)N -a1(e0+X)N"1 -c*2Ïl(60+X)N-2 fļ ^ (7) I- 1 ( XeC) . A straightforward checking shows that a X6ļ-ft0 &gt; + 00 L is an eigenvalue of A if and only if f(X) = 1 . It is easy to see that implies that f is strictly decreasing and, for X^ figuring in Theorem 1, we clearly have XjéJ-Čq, +°°[ and f ( ^) = 1. Thus X ļ &lt;0 if and only if f(0) &lt; 1, X ļ = 0 if and only if f ( 0 ) = 1, X^ &gt;0 if and only if f(0) &gt; 1. By Theorem 1, X^ is a simple eigenvalue and ReX &lt; ' ^ for all Xe ó(A)'{X^} . Therefore, from the well-known theorems on asymptotic stability, stability, and instability of autonomous linear systems, we obtain the statement of Theorem 4.</page><page sequence="9">365 Rama/ik 3 .. Under the conditions of Theorem 4, using the function (6), the existence, even the uniqueness of an eigenvalue of A in the interval ] -30 , + 00 [ , can be proved independently of Theorem 1. Indeed, obviously, lim f = 0 and, + oo under the condition aM &gt; 0 , also lim f = + 00 . Since f is . ? , -B¿+0 continuous and strictly . monotone, there exists a unique K in the interval ]-30 » + 00 [ for which f(Aj) = 1 . Hence ó(A)n] -ß0 , + »[= {xļ} as stated above.
