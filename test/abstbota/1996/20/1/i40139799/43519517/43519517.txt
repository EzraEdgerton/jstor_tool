Abstract: It is argued that conspecific pairs of subspecies within a genus should have a consistent degree of similarity - at least greater than that between pairs of distinct species in that genus. Numerical methods are used to re-examine the existing classification of the genus Drosera (with over sixty distinct species) in Australia. Though most subspecies pairs show much greater similarity than most species pairs, two subspecies of D. stolonifera deviate widely from the other three. In contrast, several pairs of species within the genus resembled one another as much as conspecific pairs of subspecies. Introduction A number of taxonomie categories have been devised to accommodate variants below the species level. These range from subspecies , variety , subvariety, form and subform, which are recognized in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, to an array of terms based on breeding systems, ecological differentiation or on orthodox taxonomy based on morphology. In contrast, the Zoological and Bacteriological Codes only recognize the infraspecific taxon subspecies. The historical application and taxonomie significance of the subspecies in plants has been outlined in detailed discussions by Davis &amp; Hey wood (1963), Hawkes (1963) and Stace (1980). In animals, the term sub- species was considered as an infraspecific category implying "geographic race" and was defined by Mayr (1969) as an aggregate of phenotypically similar populations of a species, inhabiting a geographic sub - . division of the range of a species , and differing taxonomically from other populations of the species ." In botanical taxonomy most definitions of subspecies derive from one developed by Du Rietz (which is similar to the zoological definition). It recognized sub- species as " ..a population of several biotypes forming more or less distinct regional fades of a species " (Du Rietz 1930). In botany, however, this definition is fre- quently extended to cover cytological or genetic variants which have some correlated geographic dif- ferentiation but may have only small morphological differences.' Plant races with different ploidy levels or which are genetic lines of inbreeding taxa are often as- signed subspecies rank or sometimes species rank or even variety. This extension of the botanical sub- species definition to include characters other than mor- phology and geography has resulted in divergence between the definition of subspecies in zoological and botanical taxonomy. Hawkes (1963) concluded that it was as impractical to give a rigid definition of subspecies as it was to give one for species. He presented a definition adapted from Tutin (1957) as: "Taxa differing from one another in minor mor- phological characters and either partially or completely isolated from each other by means of geographical , ecological, physiological , cytogenetical or other barriers ( but in some cases potentially capable of interbreeding without substantial reduction infertility)". In the past thirty years the category subspecies has been widely used in flora treatments and monographs</page><page sequence="2">2 Goodall &amp; Marchant: Drosera taxonomy to segregate a segment of a species with a distinct geographic area and more or less distinct morphology. There are usually two or more macroscopic dis- criminating attributes, and these are usually quantita- tive or minor qualitative characters such as petal colour. There is often intergradation between sub- species - often regarded by plant taxonomists as in- dicative of subspecies rank rather than species rank, which usually implies more discrete entities. If two taxa occur in the same geographic area, yet retain their distinctness, then they are usually assigned species rank because it is often assumed that they do not cross, despite the apparent opportunity, and therefore they are genetically distinct. It is often assumed by the taxonomist that, where subspecies overlap, crossing is a distinct possibility and may in fact be the cause of a blurred subspecies boundary. Not all floras are well known, and some modern usage of the category sub- species regards it as a convenient "dumping ground" for taxa where variation is imperfectly known, often because of insufficient herbarium material and few or no associated field observations. Ideally, taxonomists could refer to a quantitative measure of distinctness for infraspecific taxa as well as for species and other categories. In zoological taxonomy there are relatively rigid guidelines to sub- stantiate recognition of subspecies. Zoologists may adopt a "75% rule", where a population is recognized as a valid subspecies if 75% of the individuals differ in the relevant character from all (in practice, 97%) of the individuals of another subspecies (Mayr 1969). Plant taxonomists would prefer to have this figure closer to 90%, where almost all individuals of a population, which is usually represented by a small sample of her- barium specimens, differ from other subspecies. Clearly, as in the case of species, there are no definite criteria for assigning subspecies rank. In current usage, the degree of taxonomie distinctness is judged on the broad overview of the taxonomist, or rarely a team of taxonomists, who assess discontinuity on its merit for each taxon, with the result that it is often difficult to be consistent. The degree of consistency attained depends on how thorough field studies have been, as well as on preconceived notions of the range of differences in re- lated taxa. In due course, it may be possible to assign taxonomie rank on the basis of the proportion of the genome shared. However, until means of quantifying degrees of taxonomie similarity are widely accepted, decisions on assigning appropriate taxonomie rank will continue to be based on readily observable characters and will be arbitrary. As a result, the criteria used to distinguish between subspecies will vary between plant families, so that a subspecies of one particular family may not be comparable in its "magnitude", its taxonomie dis- tinctness or even evolutionary significance to that of another family. In contrast, for the subspecies of a par- ticular genus, the type of distinction should be relative- ly consistent. Within a given higher taxon, it is desirable that lower taxa are grouped consistently within a family for in- stance, the species within each genus differ by the same "amount", in some sense. If this were not so, a taxonomist would be inclined either to lump species in genera where they differed little, or perhaps to separate a genus where the differences were great into two or more genera. Although this general background lies behind much of taxonomy, it is rarely made explicit because of difficulty in quantifying the extent of any differences. Given an acceptable measure of similarity, it seems that the similarity between subspecies pairs within a genus should, in all cases, be greater than the similarity between distinct species of that genus. We attempt to implement this principle in the present paper. A probabilistic approach Techniques of numerical taxonomy provide a possible approach to this problem; but most such techniques meet the stumbling block of incommensurability of the various attributes involved in the comparisons. If the attributes are coded as binary variables, say, and the number of agreements or differences in these variables is used as a measure of similarity or "distance", the result may depend greatly upon the coding principles used. This difficulty is avoided by the use of probability as a common measure for different types of attribute (Goodall 1966). For each attribute, let us consider all the values recorded in the universe of discourse, and calculate for each pair of values the probability that a random pair would be as similar as the pair in question. Then for any pair of taxa (OTU' s), one takes the probability for each pair of attribute values observed in them, and combines the probability over all attributes. This probability may be considered as an inverse measure of the overall similarity between the two taxa in ques- tion. Certain conventions need to be established for the rela- tive similarity of different pairs of attribute values. For qualitative attributes, it goes without saying that a pair of different values is less similar than a pair of the same values; but are all pairs with the same value to be regarded as equally similar? Here again probability concepts are invoked, and a more improbable match-</page><page sequence="3">Abstracta Botanica 20 ( 1 996) 3 ing of values is regarded as indicating greater similarity than the matching of two frequently ob- served values. If a genus includes twenty species with white flowers, say, four with yellow, and two with red, the two red-flowered species are considered more similar in respect of flower colour than two of the yel- low-flowered species, which in turn are more similar than two of the white-flowered species; and any such pair would be more similar in this respect than any pair in which the flower colour differed. The concept that similarity is greater where two OTU' s share an uncom- mon character than where the character they share is common to the bulk of the OTU' s considered has been criticised by Sneath and Sokal (1973); but in our ex- perience it corresponds with the intuitive approach of most taxonomists. Where attribute values are quantitative (measure- ments, for instance), it is reasonable to regard similarity as being expressed inversely by the dif- ference in values, though it should be noted that this will be modified by the scale used (a logarithmic scale will give results different from those with an arith- metic scale). Attributes which are not quantitative but whose values can be ordered need to be treated dif- ferently again. The principle adopted is that one pair of values is more similar than another pair if the probability of a value falling within the range of the former is less than that for the latter. Supposing we have an ordered set of values A, B, C, D and E, with probabilities (frequencies) of 0.4, 0.3. 0.2, 0.08 and 0.02 respectively, then values C and E (including 0.3 of the population of values within their range) are con- sidered more similar than values A and B (with 0.7). Combination of probabilities for the various pairs of attribute values observed, on the assumption (under the null hypothesis) that the attributes are independent, then gives a probability for the whole set of paired values (or any more improbable set), which is an in- verse measure of the similarity between two OTU' s characterized by the set of paired values. Putting the paragraphs above into symbolic form, one defines for each type of attribute a difference function: Dijk expressing the difference between OTU i and OTU j in respect of attribute k. For qualitative attributes, of which a particular value g is shown by of the OTU's out of the total of N Ģjtg = M) Dyk - Hg for two OTU' s each with the value g. If the two OTU' s have different values for this attribute, Dy/c = N For ordered (but non-quantitative) attributes, we define 5 Ay* ~ 8=r where OTU i has the value r and OTU j the value s. For quantitative attributes, with values g^, gjb respec- tively, Dijk = I gik - gjk I For each attribute, it is then necessary to estimate the probability that a random pair of OTU' s from the set will have a value of less than or equal to the pair a,b under consideration. This probability is estimated by its observed frequency in the observed data set: Pabk - mabk where is the number of pairings observed with less than or equal to the value D^, and Nk is the num- ber of pairings for which this value could be calculated (i.e., excluding OTU's for which attribute k had not been, or could not be, observed) These values having been calculated for each attribute Ķ they need to be combined over all attributes. This can be done exactly, if the number of attributes and the number of alternatives for p ^ is small. Otherwise, one uses the method for combining continuous probabilities due to Fisher (1932), as modified by Lan- caster (1949) to give an approximation for discon- tinuous probabilities : = ļ!-'1 é P'~P: where p'¡ is the value in the discrete probability series next smaller than the observed value p¡. On the as- sumption that the w probabilities observed are in- dependent, X2 is then distributed as %2 with 2 w degrees of freedom, and the cumulative probability from this distribution is Py, which expresses inversely the overall similarity of OTU's i and j. Goodall (1966) expressed similarity as the comple- ment of the probability thus calculated: (1 - P). However, this leads to unwieldy figures like .99999, and it seems more convenient to use a logarithmic</page><page sequence="4">4 Goodall &amp; Marchant: Drosera taxonomy scale. Thus, for the purpose of this paper, we define a similarity index Sļj = - log io Pļj where P ¡j is the probability that the sets of attribute values observed in the ťth and / th taxa, or any less probable sets, could arise by chance assortment of the values of these attributes recorded in the whole collec- tion of taxa under discussion1. Application to Drosera Complete descriptive data The probabilistic approach described has been applied to data for the genus Drosera of insectivorous plants. All taxa within the genus occurring in Australia were included in the study. To those recognized in the Flora of Australia (Marchant et al. 1982) were added ten new presumptive species and three presumptive subspecies still in manuscript, giving a total of 67 species, of which six have been divided into 15 subspecies (see list in Appendix A). These taxa were described in terms of 80 attributes, as follows: Geographical distribution 4 Habitat 2 Phenology 1 Underground organ 4 Stem 6 Leaf and petiole 28 Stipule 8 Inflorescence 9 Calyx 7 Corolla 6 Gynoecium 5 Total 80 A list of the attributes and coding system used is given in Appendix B. The data were gathered from her- barium specimens which were used to produce the taxonomie account. Quantitative attributes were developed from all available herbarium specimens, ranging from samples of only 5 sheets in rarer or poor- ly collected taxa to hundreds in the case of widespread and common taxa. Every effort was made to define the attributes in such a way that there was no logical interdependence among them, and that evident biological interdepen- dence (e.g. in the size of different floral organs) was kept to a minimum. This is important because the null hypothesis underlying the method is independence of the attributes - the probability calculated is that of having two taxa as similar as the pair in question if the attribute values of each were independent random samples of the values in the population. Of these attributes, 51 were qualitative (41 having two alternative values only, the others more), 16 were or- dered but not quantitative, and 13 were quantitative. Often an attribute would be undefined (for instance, the hairiness of the aerial stem in a taxon without aerial stems) or unrecorded, and the calculations took into account the lack of information in such cases. Where an attribute had two possible values, but some of the taxa were variable in respect of it, the attribute was treated as ordered, variable taxa taking an intermediate position between the two extremes. In fact, the majority of binary variables were treated in this way for reasons which will appear, even though none of the taxa might be variable in respect of the attribute. A matrix of similarity values (2850 in number) between all pairs among the 76 taxa was calculated. The dis- tribution of the probabilities was very far from the uniform distribution (between 0 and 1) expected on the null hypothesis of random assortment of attribute values. This is shown in Table 1. There were clearly many more high similarities than would be expected if all the taxa had similar status and the attribute values had been randomly distributed among them. In all, 63 had values of S¡j exceeding 3, whereas the total number expected on the null hypothesis of random distribution of attribute values among the taxa was less than three. On inspection of the similarity matrix, it became ap- parent that most of the very high values applied to recognized pairs of subspecies: 1 The computer programs (in FORTRAN) for calculating the indices used in this paper have been described by Goodall et al.

These comparisons gave the following similarity values: subsp. compacta subsp. montícola D . stolonifera 0.74 1 .59 subsp. humilis subsp. rupicola 1.15 1.71 subsp. stolonifera 0.71 0.87 Thus, these other subspecies of D. stolonifera show no close affinity with subsp. compacta or subsp. mon - ticola. The latter two subspecies are also not par- ticularly close to each other (S¡j 1.38). High similarities are also shown in taxa regarded as distinct species. Taking the value 3.7, the smallest value between subspecies in the first list, as a possible cut-off point for subspecies recognition, we have listed in Table 2 comparisons between species pairs which show greater similarity. The pair { D. grievei , D. sargentii } is shown to be more similar than most of the pairings of recognized subspecies. The next pairing on the list associates another species (D. penicillaris) with one of the sub- species of D. menziesii - in fact, showing closer similarity than that between the two recognized sub- species, menziesii and thysanosepala. The latter also shows close similarity with D. penicillaris (Sy 3.78). Consequently, it seems reasonable to suggest that D. penicillaris should be regarded as a subspecies of D. menziesii. D. manniana and D. walyunga are also shown to be more similar than most of the pairings of recognized subspecies. The same applies, with only slightly less similarity, to D . burmanni and D. 2 Authorities for species and subspecies will be found in the Appendix A.</page><page sequence="6">6 Goodall &amp; Marchant: Drosera taxonomy Table 2.

These three pairs, and D. grievei and D. sargentii , will accordingly be treated as four "candidate" species. The pair D. manniana and D. walyunga needs a little more consideration than the others, because D. man- niana also shows a strong similarity to D. rechingeri. The third pairwise comparison however (that between D. rechingeri and D. walyunga) does not show a par- ticularly high similarity (Sý 2.62). The battery of probabilistic tests available includes an affinity index (Goodall 1968) as an expression of the probability that a set of attribute values shown by one OTU would be as similar to those of a subset of other OTU' s by ran- dom assortment. When the affinity of D. rechingeri to the other pair was tested, the probability of the affinity shown was .0082 - not particularly low, and indeed higher than that of two other species - D. dichrosepala (0.0049) or D. pulchella (0.0070). We conclude that the similarity of D. rechingeri to D. manniana is not such as to justify including it as another subspecies Table 3. Similarities among a group of eight species.

D. pycnoblasta with the other two; D. manniana and D. walyunga thus become a fifth "candidate" species. The remaining instances of high similarity are a more complex case. There is a group of four species, D. leucoblasta , D. parvula, D. platystigma and D. pyc- noblasta , all of which are linked by pairwise similarities greater than 3.84. Two others, D. paleacea and D. pulchella, are also closely linked with the group, the indices ranging from 2.71 upwards. A seventh species, D. dichrosepala , is also closely linked with D. platystigma and somewhat less closely with D. paleacea and D. pulchella , whereas its links with the other three are within an acceptable range of interspecific comparisons. Yet another species, D. nitidula , is closely linked with D. pulchella as indi- cated above, and also shows some linkage with D. platystigma in the core group of four species. The com- plete matrix of indices for these eight species is shown in Table 3. It seems that there may be an a priori case for regarding at least the first four of these species, and possibly all eight, as subspecies of a single species. Since the distribution of the similarities calculated depends on the context - on the whole Drosera data set in this case - it is likely to be distorted by the presence of a few extremely close similarities. Their presence may indeed be almost equivalent to duplicating the data for some of the taxa. It was accordingly decided to try to confirm some of the conclusions reached by repeating the analysis after combining the data for sub- species, wherever the initial analysis had confirmed the conclusions of traditional taxonomy - that is, the subspecies of D. subhirtella , D. neesii , D. marchantii , D. menziesii, D. macrantha and the three subspecies of D. stolonifera. The separate values for subspecies in the matrix were replaced by single values for the species as a whole. This left a new total of 68 taxa, in-</page><page sequence="7">Abstracta Botanica 20 ( 1 996) 7 Table 4. Similarities after combining subspecies.

The resulting similarity matrix included eight values above 4.00, as shown in Table 4. Thus, some of the conclusions from the complete similarity matrix are confirmed by this second matrix reduced by the combination of the subspecies. The high similarity between D. menziesii and D. penicil- laris is confirmed now that the two recognized sub- species of the former have been combined, and there seems every reason to regard D. penicillaris as another subspecies of D. menziesii. The pairs { D . grievei , D. sargentii }, {D. manniana, D. walyunga) and {D. auriculata , D. peltata } continue to show high similarity, with probabilities well within the range ob- served in the original matrix for pairs of recognized subspecies. The two pairs {D. nitidula , D. pulchella) and { D . bur- manni , D. spatulata) mentioned in connection with Table 2 have, after combining subspecies (as in Table 4), indices respectively of 3.69 and 3.03, which, though lower than those mentioned above, are still high enough to be regarded as supporting the sub- specific status of these paired taxa. Four of the other high similarities concern species within the grouping of eight in Table 3. All these 28 similarities from the new matrix are listed in Table 5. Again, D. leucoblasta, D. parvula, D. platystigma and D. pycnoblasta all have similarity indices within the range for subspecies in the complete matrix (despite the reduced number of comparisons), so it seems reasonable to regard these four taxa as differing only at the subspecific level. Drosera paleacea and D. pul- chella are only slightly less closely associated with them. Drosera dichrosepala is somewhat more remote again, though closely related to the group. The close Table 5.

As a next step, the six very close pairs were combined, so that D. penicillaris was combined with the two recognized subspecies of D. menziesii ; and the follow- ing pairs of supposed species were combined into the "candidate" species mentioned above: {D. manniana , D. walyunga}, {D. grievei, D. sargentii }, {£&gt;. auriculata , D. peltata}, {D. nitidula , D. pulchella) and [D. burmanni, D. spatulata}. A new similarity matrix was calculated among the 62 resulting taxa. The closest remaining similarities in the matrix are shown in Table 6. Most of these high similarities involve the group of species around D. platystigma (see Tables 2 and 4). Two others involve the "candidate" species {D. man-</page><page sequence="8">8 Goodall &amp; Marchant: Drosera taxonomy niana, D. waly unga}. The relationship between D. rechingeri and D. manniana (though not with D. waly unga) has already been mentioned, but attention has not previously been drawn to a relationship with D. sargentii and D. grievei , now combined in another "candidate" species. Comparisons between the original similarity matrix (with all subspecies separated) and the matrix after recognized subspecies had been combined are as follows : Subspecies treated Subspecies separately combined D.

The fact that D. walyunga shows no close similarity to any of these other taxa except D. man- niana , however, seems to be an argument for retaining these taxa as three separate, though closely linked, species. The group around D. platystigma (which seems to be another nodal taxon) remains to be considered. The similarities for this group in the new matrix are shown in Table 7. Again, D. leucoblasta, D. parvula, D. platystigma and D. pycnoblasta show high values ( S¿j above 3.5); al- though there are a few other high values in the Table, no other species is linked to all four of the core group. If a test of affinity with this core group is performed, the lowest probabilities found are for the "candidate" species {D. pulchella , D. nitidula } (0.00015) and D. Table 7.

These seven taxa are all grouped by the Flora of Australia (see Appendix A), in the Section Lamprolepis, together with D. occiden- talism D. barbi g e ra, D. scorpioides and D. omissa which in this analysis are not shown to be particularly close. Drosera dichrosepala, however (also in the Sec- tion Lamprolepis), is close to D. platystigma and to D. nitidula within the group discussed above, and also fairly close to D. occidentalis ( Sļj 3.06 in the original matrix; 2.68 after combination of all other subspecies) and D. scorpioides (2.59 and 2.42 respectively), so it may serve to link these species to the core group. Yet another linkage is worth mentioning in this con- nection. The "candidate" species {D. manniana , D. walyunga) shows affinity with the D. platystigma group (probability .0083); and when a similarity matrix of species only (including "candidate" species) was calculated, the similarity between these two "can- didate" species was very high (5# 5.89) - higher than that between the D. platystigma group and D. paleacea (5.27). The previous similarity matrix clarifies this relationship, for almost all pairings between the taxa in these two "candidate" species show high similarity, though not at the subspecific level (Table 8). It will be noted that all these similarities in the original matrix were below any of those between taxa accepted here as subspecies (minimum value 3.70). Thus these two groups should be regarded as related at the species (rather than the subspecies) level, albeit closely, and D. platystigma seems to be a nodal taxon linking three others at subspecific level, and three other species or "candidate" species, within the Section Lamprolepls. Test using morphological attributes only Traditional taxonomists might criticise the results reported here because the attributes taken into account here include a number which would often be ignored, or given little weight. Accordingly, we repeated the in- itial analysis using only qualitative morphological att- ributes (together with flower colour) and omitting all depending on measurement, as well as all of a geo- graphical, ecological or phenological character. This left a total of 61 attributes, distributed as follows: Underground organ 4 Stem 5 Leaf and petiole 23</page><page sequence="9">Abstracta Botanica 20 ( 1 996) 9 Table 8.

Other high similarities (S,y &gt; 3) are shown in Table 9. Most of the very high similarities using all attributes (Table 2) are mirrored in this new list. But the similarities between subspecies (even excluding the "rogue" subspecies of D. stolonifera) extend con- siderably further down the scale, and have a much wider overlap with similarities between entities which have been considered species. Even if the two least similar among the subspecies pairs (D. menzie'sii , and D. stolonifera subspp. stolonifera and rupicola) are ex- cluded, no less than 14 pairwise comparisons among presumptive species fall into this range; and, if these two comparisons are included (bringing the lower limit for subspecies to 2.25), the number of pairs of "species" to fall into this range is 66 (as against 17 where all attributes are taken into account). Several discrepancies between the two lists (Tables 2 and 9) are evident. There are five pairs in the list based on all attributes which do not appear in the second list based on morphological attributes (the similarity in which is shown in parentheses): D. paleacea and D. platystigma (2.86); D. burmanni and D. spatulata (2.61); D. parvula and D. platystigma (2.42); D. platystigma and D. pycnoblasta (2.34); D. nitidula and D. pulchella (1.95). All except the last are in fact within the range for subspecific pairs. The list based on</page><page sequence="10">10 Goodall &amp; Marchant: Drosera taxonomy Table 9.

The great majority of these pair- ings also showed high similarity in the analysis includ- ing all attributes, often only slightly below the limit set there for subspecies pairs. Thus, the analysis based only on morphological attri- butes provides broad confirmation of that with the complete set, though the latter seems rather more sen- sitive in identifying subspecific status. If the same logic had been applied as before, relying on the morphological attributes only, a lower limit for subspecific similarity might have been set at 3.00, say. In the case of the D. stolonifera subspecies, only subsp. humilis and subsp. rupicola would have been regarded as belonging to the same species, and D. stolonifera subsp. stolonifera would stand on its own. D. menziesii subsp. menziesii and D. penic illaris would be com- bined as subspecies, but D. menziesii subsp. thysanosepala would be separated (its similarity with D. penicillaris is 2.22, so that it is close to both, but not related to them at the subspecific level). Several of the "candidate" species proposed on the basis of the whole attribute set would also be recog- nized here: {D. grievei, D. sargentii }, {D. manniana , D. walyunga] y {D. peltata , D. auriculata). The pairs {D. spatulata , D. burmanni }, { D . nitidula , D. pulchel- la} would not be so recognized. A new pairing recog- nized here, which was less marked when all attributes were taken into account, is that between D. petiolaris and D. glanduligera (in the previous analysis the similarity was 3.19). In the Flora of Australia the two species were placed in different Sections, each of which is monotypie. As for the grouping in Section Lamprolepis, the three taxa D. leucoblasta , D. pycnoblasta and D. parvula are all linked at subspecific level, but the similarities of D. platystigma with the first two are rather less; the similarity between D. platystigma and D. dichrosepala would, however, justify associating these two as sub- species. Discussion It is gratifying that taxonomie judgement is so largely vindicated by the results of the numerical analysis. Though there are no objective grounds for setting a</page><page sequence="11">Abstracta Botanica 20 (1996) 11 limiting value of similarity to define the concept of subspecies, it is at least reasonable to expect pairs of subspecies to be more similar than pairs of taxa recog- nized as distinct species. And in general this is true in the present data. Out of the 2850 pairwise comparisons between taxa, the similarity index exceeded 4.00 for 22; of these, nine were between subspecies of the same species. Indeed, except for D. stolonifera (see below), all subspecific comparisons have these high similarities. Thus, in this particular data set, a similarity value of 4.0 or more would support a view that the taxa in question differ at the subspecific rather than the specific level. The numerical results described in this paper are not to be considered as defining taxa or determining their taxonomie status. They provide additional information upon which these decisions can be based. Thus we do not present new circumscriptions of the Drosera taxa revealed by the present study as "candidates" for change in taxonomie status. However, there are some interesting observations on the taxonomie history and morphology of the candidate taxa which are relevant and again indicate that the results of the numerical analysis in the present study may even be vindicated in these "candidate" taxa. Subspecies comparison The high similarities observed between conspecific subspecies do not extend to the taxa subsumed under D. stolonifera , and these deserve closer examination. Drosera stolonifera subsp. stolonifera seems reasonably close to subsp. rupicola and subsp. humilis, and these two are highly similar to each other. But D. stolonifera subsp. compacta and subsp. montícola are no more similar to the other recognized subspecies, or to one another, than are many pairs of species within the genus. Drosera stolonifera , which is endemic to southwestern Australia, is a diverse species complex which may in- clude at least three distinct taxa and possibly two others which themselves are very variable in morphol- ogy. It is not surprising that the present numerical analysis indicated that Drosera stolonifera subsp. compacta and subsp. montícola may each warrant recognition at species rank. The flower morphology of all of the members of the complex is quite uniform; however the gross morphology, leaf shape and arran- gement differ markedly. D. stolonifera subsp. compac- ta unlike the other subspecies has a highly reduced aerial stem and a remarkable prostrate upper stolon. D. stolonifera subsp. montícola is a diminutive taxon which has the gross morphology of the other taxa and was considered by Lowrie and Marchant (1992) as closest to D. stolonifera subsp. compacta , but differing in a number of characters such as presence or absence of additional tubers and long petioles. It is thus quite plausible that these two subspecies warrant recogni- tion at species level. However, it would be preferable to undertake a new numerical study to include recently discovered taxa in the D. stolonifera complex. Interspecific comparisons We have shown that several pairs of species have similarities well within the range for subspecific com- parisons elsewhere in the genus. Drosera grievei and D. sargentii are more similar than any pair of sub- species except those within D. subhirtella. Drosera manniana and D. walyunga are also very similar. Drosera penicillaris is very similar to D. menziesii subsp. menziesii , and only somewhat less so to subsp. thysanosepala of the same species. Other pairs show- ing similarity within the "subspecies range" are D. bur- manni and D. spatulata , D. nitidula and D. pulchella , D. auriculata and D. peltata. Consistency in the allocation of subspecific and specific rank within the genus would accordingly call for D. penicillaris to be reduced to a subspecies of D. menziesii , and for the five other pairs mentioned to be treated as single species, each with two subspecies. We concluded from the more elaborate numerical analysis that D. leucoblasta, D. parvula, D. platy stigma and D. pycnoblasta could best be regarded as subspecies of a single species, close to but separate from D. paleacea and to the pair already mentioned, D. nitidula and D. pulchella. The varying levels of separation may well indicate that the genus in southwestern Australia is in a state of rapid evolution, with species distinctions and genetic barriers not yet fully established. Drosera burmanni and D. spatulata were regarded by Marchant et al. (1982) as belonging to different Sec- tions of the genus, largely discriminated on the basis of the number of styles. Drosera burmanni has five styles "and ranges throughout south and east Asia to northern and eastern Australia. Drosera spatulata has three styles and ranges from Papua New Guinea to New Zealand, through eastern Australia. It is possible that too much weight has been placed on style number as a character to discriminate these species, and in fact the Sections to which they belong. An assessment of this character needs to be made and if it is indicated that little weight should be placed on it then it is likely that a taxonomie decision to relegate D. spatulata to a sub- species of D. burmanni is warranted.</page><page sequence="12">12 Goodall &amp; Marchant: Drosera taxonomy Drosera peltata ranges from India to Japan and south- wards to eastern and southwestern Australia. It has a very variable morphology; for example its sepals may vary from hairy to glabrous. Drosera auriculata is restricted to southeastern Australia and is recognized largely on having glabrous sepals. Conn (1981) jus- tifiably questioned the usefulness of characters such as calyx indumentum and concluded that D. auriculata and D. peltata are conspecific. Marchant et al. (1982) also recognized that D. auriculata is often difficult to separate morphologically from D. peltata; however, he chose to recognize the taxa at the species level be- cause they occur sympatrically in southeastern Australia, where they can be consistently recognized as distinct taxa even in the same location. It is undoub- tedly true that the taxa are very similar and that the variation in one which covers such a large geographic area can easily accommodate the other taxon. However, if it is generally accepted that subspecies should be separated spatially, it seems best, or at least convenient, to regard them as separate species until their genetic distinctness indicates otherwise. Drosera penicillaris was originally regarded by its author, Bentham (1864), as possibly a variety of a species now regarded as a taxonomie synonym of Drosera menziesii. Marchant et al. (1982) also regarded D. penicillaris as conspecific with D. men- ziesii , but later he became aware of the different habitat preference, slightly different habit and the lighter petal colour of D. penicillaris in comparison with D. menziesii. However, it seems plausible in the light of the present study that D. penicillaris may best be regarded as a subspecies of D. menziesii. The remaining three pairs of taxa considered as can- didate subspecies in the present paper, namely {D. grievei , D. sargentii }, [D. manniana , D. walyunga} and {D. nitidula, D. pule he lia}, belong to Drosera Section Lamprolepls. This is a large Section of mor- phologically similar species restricted to southwestern Australia. Since the preparation of the present paper 13 new taxa have been described, making a total of thirty species in the Section. In comparison, Marchant et al. (1982) recognized only twelve species in Section Lamprolepls. Clearly, a numerical analysis of all of these taxa is needed so that a review of the taxonomie status of all species can be made. Geographical and other attributes As already remarked in the Introduction, some authors consider subspecies status as appropriate to taxa which are morphologically very similar, but differ in their geographical distribution, or their ecology. We ap- proached this question by repeating the treatment using morphological attributes only. It is not ap- propriate to use the same limiting similarity as before when the number of attributes has been drastically reduced. It may, however, be noted that there seems here to be more overlap between the intraspecific and the interspecific similarities than when all attributes have been taken into account. Ignoring D. stolonifera subsp. compacta and subsp. montícola , similarities between subspecies of the same species (ten in num- ber) may be as low as 2.25. There are eight such comparisons with values above 3.0, whereas there are 31 interspecific comparisons at this level. This tends to negate the assumption that geographical separation is particularly important in the recognition of subspecies, for that would rather lead one to expect an increase in the distinction between intra- and interspecific comparisons as a result of limit- ing consideration to morphological attributes. In this connection, it may be worth noting that geographical distribution and ecological features were rather super- ficially included in the study. Geographical distribu- tion is represented only by three binary attributes and one other qualitative variable. Ecological observations are limited to two binary attributes (association with wet habitats, or with granite, in southwestern Australia). Modifications to the technique recently developed (Goodall 1994) will make possible a more adequate treatment of pattern of geographical distribu- tion. References Bentham, G. 1864.
